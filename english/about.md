I'm **Julieta Arancio**, a PhD student at [Universidad de Quilmes](https://unq.edu.ar) based currently in Geneva-Switzerland, from  Buenos Aires-Argentina. I study the open science hardware (GOSH) movement in Latin America and its contribution to science and technology democratisation. 

I'm currently in my 3rd year (of five). My work is supported by the [National Scientific & Technical Research Council (CONICET)](http://www.conicet.gov.ar) and developed at [Centro de Investigaciones para la Transformación (CENIT)](http://www.fund-cenit.org.ar).
