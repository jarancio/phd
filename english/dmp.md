# El movimiento de Hardware Científico de Código Abierto (GOSH) en América Latina: ¿Una alternativa democratizante de producción tecnológica?

## Data Management Plan

### Data Collection

Data will be collected of each open science hardware initiative from Latin America that has participated in any of the Global Open Science Hardware gatherings up to now (2016, 2017, 2018).

This includes general information about each project (name, location, web repositories, start year, members, goals & vision, tools used, communication methods, resources, activities) and about its members (name, frequency and type of collaboration, specialty, education level).

**Sources of data include:**

a) Publicly available in online repositories (GOSH website, OSF, Docubriks, Kitspace, etc)

b) Online questionnaire using LimeSurvey, an open source software tool

c) Semi-structured interviews

**Formats** 

For a) and b), data will be stored in comma-separated values (.csv) format. Any maps generated will consist of code in GeoJSON format. For c), data will be stored in text files with markdown format.

The choice of these formats is based on their standard acceptance by the open science community, minimum storage & backup capacity required and easy future reutilization of data. Data from b) and c) will be previously anonymized.

Data collected will be tracked using git for version control.

**Names and coding**

a) .csv files: PROJECTNAME_PUBLIC

b) .csv files: PROJECTNAME_SURVEY; .md files: PROJECTNAME_SURVEYTXT. Questions are coded and replies checked with data entry validation methods.

c) .md files: PROJECTNAME_SE

### Documentation and Metadata

Data will be accompanied by an abstract of the project and reference to GOSH community materials.

### Ethics and Legal Compliance

Data collection through online survey and semi-structured interviews will be done prior obtaining consent from the participants. Participants' identity will be protected via anonymisation of the data. Storage and backups of data are encrypted using VeraCrypt.

Data will be licensed under Open Data Commons Attribution Licence (ODC-By).

### Storage and Backup

Data will be stored in three locations, backed-up automatically:

1. Local laptop

2. [CENIT](http://www.fund-cenit.org.ar/) personal drive (back up)

3. External hard drive (back up)

All folders containing data will be encrypted using [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html).

### Selection and Preservation

All data can be used in the future to monitor the evolution of the Open Science Hardware community, build community metrics, used by projects to apply for funding, disseminating GOSH work, inform policy makers and more.

Long-term preservation plan is to release the thesis and its related data in Universidad Nacional de Quilmes official [repository](https://ridaa.unq.edu.ar/)

### Data Sharing

Data will be shared after thesis publication through Universidad Nacional de Quilmes [institutional repository](https://ridaa.unq.edu.ar/).

Besides, it will be shared in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), which provides a persistent identifier for the data.

Publication will be announced in community websites and forums to facilitate people to find it.

### Responsibilities and Resources

Responsable for data management: Julieta Arancio (jarancio@fund-cenit.org.ar), who is carrying on this PhD work.
