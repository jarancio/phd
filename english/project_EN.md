## Abstract
Following the massive diffusion of Internet access and the drop in prices of electronic components, ideas from the Free Open Source Software (FOSS) movement have spread over the last decade to different areas, such as hardware or knowledge production. The increasing availability of educational kits, which has lowered  access barriers to neglected users, has also contributed to a boom of highly diverse Open Source Hardware (OSH) projects and communities. OSH is hardware developed in a collaborative way and released under open licences, in contrast to and in opposition to the current closed regime of technology production, based on patents. OSH advocates claim this new way of producing technology increases the efficiency of the innovation process, democratises access to knowledge and tools, and empowers communities to search for their own, locally produced solutions to their problems. However, this translation of the open source philosophy from digital to material technologies is still emerging and faces new challenges in different areas. Combining elements from Socio-technical Transitions framework, concepts from the Grassroot Innovation Movements approach and the Participation and Capabilities literature we expect to understand if and how OSH constitutes a democratising niche of technology production in Latin America. We will build a map of OSH initiatives in the region, complemented with information from semi-structured interviews and five (5) contrasting case studies to see how OSH visions and strategies contribute to greater participation and the development of capabilities in collaborators. We expect to provide a contribution to the analytical frameworks used to assess transitions to democratisation, and relevant information for policy design.

## Project title  
The Open Source Hardware movement: a democratising opportunity for Latin America?

## Introduction
The Free Open Source Software -’FOSS’- concept is not new for most people in the 21st century. Born within the MIT at the beginning of the 80's, it was first associated with Richard Stallman, the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation. The shift to the 'Open Source' paradigm during the late 90’s promoted it’s diffusion into business. Its success nowadays is evident, with extremely popular open source developments such as Android and data centers of giants such as Google or IBM using open source software. Following the massive diffusion of Internet access, open source ideas started to spread to new areas, such as science or hardware production. During the last decade due to historically low prices of electronic components and the availability of educational kits and resources that lower access barriers to what were previously neglected audiences, there has been a boom in Open Source Hardware -OSH- projects (Berchon, 2013). These are technologies released under open licences and developed in a collaborative way, in contrast to and opposition to the current closed regime of technology production, based on patents. OSH had a first 'spring' within the maker and DIY communities in the US and Europe, but during the last five years that activity has increased in other areas, such as open source scientific hardware. OSH advocates claim it increases the efficiency of the innovation process, democratises access to knowledge and tools, and empowers communities to search for their own, locally produced solutions to their problems. However, this shift in the open source philosophy from digital to material technologies is still emerging and faces new challenges in diverse areas. This research aims to understand if and how the OSH movement is a democratising alternative for technology production in the Latin America context, in order to provide useful information for local policy design.

## Objectives
**Main objective:** Understand new, democratising technological production alternatives in the Latin America context

**Specific objectives:**     
1- Analyse the socio-technical frameworks and visions within the OSH movement in Latin America    
2- Determine if and how the OSH movement constitutes an alternative niche of technology production    
3- Identify in which way the OSH development process encourages participation of usually marginalised actors    
4- Analyse if and how the OSH development process contributes to capacity building and the empowerment of collaborators

## Literature review
**New ways of producing technology.** During the last decade there has been a boom of OSH projects globally, mostly due to a drop in the price of electronic components and the increasing availability of educational kits that minimise access barriers to technology design (Berchon, 2013). This move of the open source philosophy from software to hardware implies -in an ideal situation- that the developments are made publicly available study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design (OSHWA, 2013). Based on these concepts, communities producing OSH work in a collaborative way. Members of the OSH community claim that this alternative way of producing technology has advantages in various aspects compared with the current closed regime, associated with patents and intellectual property. In terms of efficacy, they argue that the use of rapid, collaborative prototyping methodologies brings together the perspective and background knowledge of more and more diverse participants, facilitating innovation and making design more representative of a wider range of users (Nielsen, 2012; Oudshoorn and Pinch, 2005). Other arguments point out that technology production using open licences is more efficient as it enlarges the common pool of knowledge for future developments, avoiding duplicate work. There are examples of open source labware materials with similar features to those available in the market but 10 times cheaper (Pearce, 2014). Regarding democratisation, the OSH community claims that this alternative could be an opportunity for countries in the Global South, providing  an opportunity to develop local, grassroots low-cost solutions to problems that are usually neglected by mainstream actors. In this sense, they mention some paradigmatic projects that, for example, teach labs in the Global South how to build their own open source equipment (Trend Africa), or projects that facilitate community monitoring of the environment (Public Lab). However, OSH also deals with challenges in different levels, such as asymmetry in the access to electronic components in different countries, access barriers that are still high for most of the population and, mainly, institutional, as there is no regulation or policy defined as yet.

**Analytical framework.** In order to understand how this new way of developing technology (open, collaborative, decentralised) interacts with the existent, dominant way of producing technology (centralised, closed in design, patent-based) we will use the Multi Level Perspective (MLP) framework (Kemp et al., 1998; Rip y Kemp, 19998). For this research we consider technology production as a socio-technical system comprising networks of actors, institutions, material objects and knowledge that interact in order to develop innovation. The MLP approach explains socio-technical transitions -long term, multidimensional processes that transform the key parameters of a system- based on the interaction and dynamics of three levels: niche, regime and landscape. It provides a concrete way of organising and simplifying the analysis of structural, complex, large scale transformations, providing useful typologies (Smith et al., 2005; Geels and Schot, 2007). Some examples of historical analysis using this approach are ground transport (Geels, 2005), marine transport (Geels, 2002), load management (Van Driel and Schot, 2005), electrical systems (Verbong and Geels, 2007), mobility (Nykvist and Whitmarsh, 2008) and organic food production (Smith, 2006).

By **regime** we refer to the paradigm in which scientific knowledge, technologies, practices and people are embedded in a socio-technical system. Regimes impose an incremental logic and direction to change. The concept of **niche** is defined as a space where creativity and innovation are facilitated, protected from the pressure of competitive logic, and other selection pressures, imposed by the regime. Finally, the **landscape** component includes those macro factors that shape the existing regimes, occasionally opening windows of opportunity -e.g. demographic changes, new discoveries, a raise in environmental consciousness, new regulations- that niches can take advantage of and grow.

The MLP sustains that socio-technical transitions are determined by the interaction of these three levels. Usually, innovation creates changes that don't question the key elements and logic of the regime. The most radical changes appear from the interaction of multiple developments in the three levels, for which is necessary that niches grow, but also that the regime becomes more flexible and the landscape factors become favourable (Smith et al., 2010). For a niche to exist and become more than an isolated experience, is necessary to rely on a network of actors that contribute to diffusion and new knowledge production. These networks of knowledge facilitate innovation and create opportunities for scaling. The interaction between actors from different backgrounds (e.g. scientific and industry) also creates opportunities to enlarge the common knowledge pool for future developments.

We will use the Transitions framework in order to study the particular case of socio-technical change towards democratising technology. In this sense, we take Freeman's (1991) definition of innovation as the *'capacity of people to seize a new idea or method and through it generate social and material impact'*. This definition includes new technologies, processes, organisations and services that have incremental, radical or transforming impacts on social life, mainly developed by people working in networks (Stirling & Smith, 2018). At first sight, innovation may look positive and desirable, as claimed by a variety of global actors including companies, political leaders and NGOs (Scoones et al., 2015). However, the same innovation paradigm is often responsible for the undesirable consequences it claims to be addressing: environmental damage, loss of employment, inequality (Sterling & Smith, 2018). Which direction does innovation take? Who decides which alternatives are better than others? Which are the criteria being used? The vast majority of society doesn't participate in this decision-making process -mostly based on efficiency and profit indicators-, even though it society os affected by its implementation (Ely et al., 2010). In this sense, from a constructivist point of view there are many authors that point out the neglected role of users in the development of new technologies (Von Hippel, 2005). Feenberg (1999) considers that democratisation is a trend that is spreading to different social phenomena -economy, education, medicine, 'arenas' where the public is participating more and more along the years-, as a result of disputes over particular issues. During the last decades, the public has been demanding discussion of the social impact of science and technology advances (Stirling, 2008; Chilvers & Kearnes, 2016). Following this idea, Stirling (2015) proposes the concept of **'innovation democracy'** understood as the capacity of people to influence the direction of innovation, including the voices of communities with less power. Here 'democracy' includes but goes beyond the formal notions of representative or direct democracy (Shapiro & Hacker-Cordon, 1999), focusing in questioning not only the products but the consequences and the process of innovation itself (Veak, 2006, Marres, 2005)

In order to study the OSH movement through the lens of innovation democracy we consider in first place the **Grassroot Innovation Movements (GIM)** (Smith et al, 2017) which combines the multi-level perspective with elements from the Social Movements literature to address the particular case of communities producing knowledge and technology. In contrast to traditional social movements, GIM are not limited to political disputes (Hess, 2007), as their focus is knowledge and technology production. They explore alternative pathways for social change, with a component of openness and public participation in areas where institutions and markets usually don't innovate. They create spaces where learning and the production of knowledge and technology is key, using non-proprietary forms of innovation and commons (open licenses, open education resources, etc). This approach analyses **framings**, defined as a significant process that allows movements to identify and organise their experience in ways that help them connect with more powerful narratives (Snow et al, 1986). The concept is useful for understanding motivation that has its origin in GIM, how they problematise the regime and which are the visions and goals they set and promote. It also studies the **spaces** where activities are developed, not only physical -workshops, buildings, factories, neighbourhoods- but social -groups, networks, support activities-, institutional -universities, political parties, unions, associations, niche consumers- and cognitive. As part of the **strategies** developed to achieve goals, it analyses **intermediaries and networks, repertoires of action and resources** mobilised by GIM, in relation with their previous learning processes.

Second, we use categories from the **Participation** literature to understand if and how the collaborative processes of OSH production foster a greater participation of diverse collaborators. We start out from the critical work of Arnstein (1969) on how different levels of participation have direct implications with power structures within groups, even when all the voices seem to have equal importance. Gaventa (2006) mentions how participation can limit visible forms of power -hierarchy, social class- but not the invisible forms -asymmetries in access to information or time availability-. The **multidimensional participation concept** of Kelty (2014) provides a useful framework for assessing projects developed after the digital shift. On the other hand, the inclusion space and the blurred distinction between experts and non-experts can be analysed using a typology for participation in Citizen Science projects developed by Dickel & Franzen (2016) based on the **levels of expertise** proposed by Collins & Evans (2007)

Finally, we take the **Capabilities** approach to study the transformative power OSH initiatives may have in collaborators, both at the individual and collective level (Hubert, 2010). Here, people are considered as **agents** (Walker and Unterhalter 2007) responsible for developing **capabilities** (Sen, 1999) according to their individual and social goals, influenced by environmental, social and personal **conversion factors** (Robeyns, 2005). Within this frame, Crocker (2008) argues that discussions and **democratic decision making processes** are key in these groups, reinforcing the agency of participants.

Taking elements from the Transitions literature and combining them with the Innovation Democracy concept through the GIM, Participation and Capabilities approaches, we expect to understand if and how the OSH movement constitutes a democratising niche of technology production in Latin America. Though there are many studies about free software communities and democratisation, only a few research studies focus on open source hardware. We intend to systematise the observable learning from existing experiences, aiming to understand how visions and strategies put into action by the OSH movement can contribute to greater participation and empowerment of collaborators and associated communities.

## Activities and Methodology

### Methodology
A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies will be used. A database with information from all OSH experiences in Latin America will be built and complemented with semi-structured interviews with actors involved in them. Descriptive statistical techniques will be used to characterise the OSH movement in Latin America and to associate visions with democratising practices. Multiple contrasting study cases will be developed (Yin, 1984) to answer the 'how' questions associated with specific objectives 2, 3 and 4.
