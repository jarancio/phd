# About me

I'm Julieta Arancio, a PhD candidate at [Universidad de Quilmes](https://unq.edu.ar) based in Buenos Aires - Argentina, studying the open source hardware (OSHW) movement in Latin America and its contribution to technology democratisation. 

My work is supported by the [National Scientific & Technical Research Council (CONICET)](http://www.conicet.gov.ar) and developed at [Centro de Investigaciones para la Transformación (CENIT)](http://www.fund-cenit.org.ar).

I'm currently in my 2nd year (of five). In this website you'll find all the information and latest news on my thesis and related events.

### Also...

If you're interested in open source hardware, you'll probably want to take a look at these `communities` I'm part of:
