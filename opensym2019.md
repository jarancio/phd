## Feedback from doctoral consortium: 

- If title says Latin America, it has to add something differential, which are the strengths of latam approach? If not it's just a feature of the sampling and shouldnt go in title

- in the analytic framework it's missing something on theory of science, to understand the special case of knowledge production

- no need for quantitative approach, these are qualitative research questions aimed to theorize, and the data I have access to (forum stats, repo mining) won't give interesting information for this.

- if want to do a quantitative approach, analytical sociology [Peter Hedström](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hedstr%C3%B6m) can be useful

- Social network analysis is another quanti possibility, for networks and intermediaries of the niche, see Jensen??? (estoy buscando la ref que me dijo) study for an example, they also use wikidata so I'm already half way there

- regarding democratization, some types of democratization may happen some may not, that's the contribution (dissect 'democratization' in aspects that can be or not achieved by initiatives)

- the main research problem shouldn't be phrased as 'is GOSH in latin america democratizing' but 'in which ways oschw democratizes', yes/no questions are not interesting and the research questions that follow are about mechanisms

- capabilities literature should be better connected to the rest

- take out von hippel from democratization, it's just marketing for selling books and perspective from companeies (Mako was von hippel student)

- a possibility is to take the approach of [Jesper Juul](https://www.jesperjuul.net/) (game studies, video game theory), which is substractive, to define 'democracy'. He defines what a videogame is with a checklist of features, as no one in the community could define what a videogame was. (note from me: could be a gradient instead of checklist, in which initiatives move from less to more democratic)

- take a look at [Engeström's activity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_theory#Theory)

- [Stuart Geiger](https://stuartgeiger.com/)
