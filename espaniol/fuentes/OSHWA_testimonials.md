# TESTIMONIALS

## Joost Hermans - the Netherlands

Personally I am not a developer nor a user of open source hardware(oshw), but I am a strong believer in the potential of this development. People call the possibility to design and create products to customize your own life the next industrial revolution and I am convinced that this is an accurate description of what we can expect. In a world in which people are able to customize the products they use every day and share their ideas, we will be able to develop new concepts and look at problems from a different perspective. Through trial and error we will be able to develop products which will be reduce waste as well as costs and will contribute to aesthetics and ergonomics. I am really looking forward to the moment when I will have a 3D printer and will become an amateur designer.

## Tiberius Brastaviceanu - Montreal, Canada - co-founder of [www.sensorica.co](http://www.sensorica.co)

I am a developer of OSH and one of the main contributors to the [Open Value Network (OVN) model](http://valuenetwork.referata.com/).

In my opinion, OSH is a revolution - economical and cultural. The open source movement creates a lot of value for society and destroys value for classical economic entities (corporations who operate on a closed model relying on intellectual property). This errodes the capitalist model and some people are very worried about it. They perceive open source (OS) as a menace. I am predicting an *IP war* between OS communities and classical economic entities, similar to the one we’ve seen in the realm of culture (the *copyright war*). 

Some classical entities are starting to accept the fact that OS(S and H) is there to stay and are trying to adapt their value capturing model. They are redefining their mission from R&D, production and distribution to network facilitation and management. In order to preserve their power, they create innovation platforms (crowdsourcing and others) and outsource production, while they nurture and fiercely defend their brands. This is part of what [Michel Bauwens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bauwens) calls [netarchical capitalism](http://p2pfoundation.net/Netarchical_Capitalism), a new form of feudalism. 

On the other side of the spectrum, we see the emergence of the [p2p movement](http://p2pfoundation.net/Main_Page), what I call the [multitude movement](http://multitudeproject.blogspot.ca/). This movement creates p2p infrastructure for co-creation of  value and its distribution.  

The main difference between a platform and a p2p infrastructure is that the latter allows the individual to control his own output and turns the means and processes of value creation and distribution into commons - no one owns them but everyone has access to them (see also [nondominium](http://p2pfoundation.net/Nondominium) and [nondominium agreement](http://www.docracy.com/4002/topos-nondominium-agreement-1)). Platforms introduce a strong dependency between those who own and control them and those who use them. 

The problem with OS is that it still doesn't have a clearly defined and tested model for value capturing. Most OS projects are *gift economies*, meaning that contributors don’t necessarily expect immediate tangible rewards from their involvement. DIY communities have no production and distribution capabilities. For that reason, OS still maintains a relation of dependency with capitalism. The great majority of those who contribute to OS projects get their basic needs from their activities in classical organizations, corporations or others. Since corporations have manufacturing and distribution capabilities they often fill in the gap and commercialize OS(S and H), and sometimes even make it proprietary or obscure it by integrating it into proprietary technologies. This creates friction between OS communities and   classical entities, which are seen as individualistic, opportunistic, and even predatory. Fortunately, the OS movement is developing and testing its own means to capture value (see more on [this post](http://multitudeproject.blogspot.ca/2013/04/open-source-hardware-meets-p2p-economy.html)). 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production

[OVN](http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page) is a radical model that is designed to make OS economically independent from capitalism, to turn it into a powerful economic engine. [SENSORICA](http://www.sensorica.co/) is, in my opinion, the most audacious pilot project. As OS becomes economically viable and even more powerful than classical models it will induce cultural transformations. Sharing, transparency, openness, ethics, sustainability, etc. will become predominant values, because they will drive social production. In other words, [commons-based peer production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production) depends on these values in order to function properly. 

The open product is superior to the closed product. I argue about this in [this post](http://multitudeproject.blogspot.ca/2012/06/how-to-play-open-game-in-present-and.html). But we are still at the beginning of the adoption cycle of OSH. People don’t trust the OSH products because they still don’t believe that decentralized OS communities cannot insure quality and can service a product. We’ve seen that with OSS before. Moreover, it is still very hard to establish value exchanges or relations of co-creation or co-production between OS communities and classical companies, because OSH is usually incompatible with classical business models based on control and secrecy. We are clearly experiencing that with SENSORICA. These relations are important if we want to transfer value from the old economy to the new. Some of us are working on interfaces between classical entities and OS communities.  

Although OSH communities that are setup as DIY communities of gift economies don’t seem to have problems to attract participants, OVNs like SENSORICA do experience some problems. In other words, introducing the notion of revenue into the equation, while keeping the OS nature of the product, seems to have a negative impact on participation. I think that is mainly due to the fact that people don’t understand the model, the *[value accounting syste*m](http://valuenetwork.referata.com/wiki/Value_accounting_system), and/or don’t trust it. 

We also have problems getting Universities to participate in open innovation. We are developing [strategies and tactics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fds8yj-ErJdvUM0_hslT5gThnejotsOP5pmtAYZEVe8/edit) to convince them of the economic advantage of open innovation. I believe that the main problem is their lack of understanding and of trust in the new models for capturing value. 

When it comes to R&D funding, OSH has a lot of trouble attracting capital from governments or private entities. Lack of understanding and of trust are probably the main factors. Crowdfunding can compensate, but it is not enough. [We have developed different tactics to get funding for our OSH projects](http://www.sensorica.co/home/building-sensorica/revenues), but it is not always easy. 

## **Joshua Pearce** - **Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Technology Lab - USA**

We use and develop open source hardware in my[ lab at Michigan Tech](http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~pearce/Index.html) all the time. It has easily saved us tens of thousands of dollars while accelerating our research in solar photovoltaics and sustainability-focused technologies. We are certainly not the only lab to realize this opportunity. The concept of open-source scientific hardware is catching on like wildfire throughout the globe as documented with dozens of examples in the[ Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs](http://store.elsevier.com/Open-Source-Lab/Joshua-Pearce/isbn-9780124104624/).

The main advantages OSH has for science are: lower cost, more rapid innovation cycles, less time investment, customization and most importantly control. Those on the "tip of the spear" of their discipline can make scientific instruments that meet their exact needs and specifications to make the next great discovery or improve the latest technology. The worldwide collaboration, which is the hallmark of the open source way, is simply superior at developing technologies. Period.

This is just really getting interesting as we can start to share not only knowledge through papers and data – but also equipment designs and combining that with digital manufacturing (e.g. 3D printing) we can replicate and build on one another's work much more quickly than ever before. I am confident OSH is going to drive the next great revolution in science and technology. Each OSH design that is shared will help accelerate technology that much faster providing the opportunity to provide enormous real-world wealth for everyone.

Despite the enormous promise of OSH, there are obviously vested interests whose monopolies risk being overrun by faster innovation from the open source community. I see OSHWA's most important role being to protect small OSH players from the oppression of monolithic organizations bent on maintaining the* status quo*.
