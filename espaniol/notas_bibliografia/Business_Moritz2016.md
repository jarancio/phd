# Value creation in open-source hardware communities: Case study of Open Source Ecology    

## Future of open source survey 2016: Highlights

**Business value**

    Open source is an essential element in development strategy with more than 65% of respondents relying on open source to speed development.
    More than 55% leverage open source within their production environments.

**Engine for innovation**

    Respondents reported use of open source to drive innovation through faster, more agile development; accelerated time to market and vastly superior interoperability.
    Additional innovation is afforded by open source's quality of solutions; competitive features and technical capabilities; and ability to customize.

**Proliferation of open source business models and investment**

    More diverse business models are emerging that promise to deliver more value to open source companies than ever before. They are not as dependent on SaaS and services/support.
    Open source private financing has increased almost 4x in five years.

**Security and management**

The development of best-in-class open source security and management practices has not kept pace with growth in adoption. Despite a proliferation of expensive, high-profile open source breaches in recent years, the survey revealed that:

    50% of companies have no formal policy for selecting and approving open source code.
    47% of companies donâ€™t have formal processes in place to track open source code, limiting their visibility into their open source and therefore their ability to control it.
    More than one-third of companies have no process for identifying, tracking or remediating known open source vulnerabilities.

**Open source participation on the rise**

The survey revealed an active corporate open source community that spurs innovation, delivers exponential value and shares camaraderie:

    67% of respondents report actively encouraging developers to engage in and contribute to open source projects.
    65% of companies are contributing to open source projects.
    One in three companies have a fulltime resource dedicated to open source projects.
    59% of respondents participate in open source projects to gain competitive edge.

## Numbers of OHW market

The FOSS industry is proof of concept for viable and competitive business models based on open source. 

In 2010, 13 of the biggest OSH companies represented cumulative revenues of $50 million and growing 

Sums-up phenomena as bottom-up economics, characterized by networking, knowledge sharing, collaboration, co-creation and decentralization enabled by ICT. 

Value creation systems varies from production networks integratin external actors via crowdsourcing, open innovation, communities like wikipedia, p2p communities, networked manufacturing workshops (fablabs, techshops)

**On the process**

Highly efficient and innovative:
- OSH community comprises a huge number of like minded but heterogeneous people from all over the world who contribute in a volunteer basis
- information circulates freely
- it's sustainable in terms of resource-efficient (standardization, peer review, crowdsourcing);
- in terms of tech literacy (learning, sharing, participation)
- in terms of user empowerment (repair, service, customization)

**On motivations**

- problem solving
- reputation and signaling
- identification with the community
- learning
- altruism
- leisure

**Community**

OSHWA survey 2013 (1007 respondants)
- 70% hobbysts
- 70% programmers
- 53% engineers
- 35% designers
- 33% inventors
- 29% entrepreneurs
- 31% students
- 22% educators
- 28% researchers

More 80% for fun/learning, more than 50% creating new or better cheaper products, 50% for work or business interests.

In uses, 90% building blocks for personal use, 66% learn hw, 50% building blocks for work projects

## Licensing

The aim of licenses is to balance rights of authors derived from copyright law with principles of open source. They make sure ideas may freely circulate and attribution to contributors is given.

In OSH projects the aim is to implement an idea in a physical object - schematics and designs are subject to copyright law, but the tangible product is not. 

The control oven manufacturing and distribution can be done through patents (incompatible with OS principles) or through trademark - a logo or name identifying OSH and linking it to a company/org in terms of quality, reputation and recognizability (Arduino).

The most used licences are TAPR Open Hardware License, CERN OHL 

## Business models

Organizations tend to apply a mix of different models, some of them are not full open source but mixed.

Two types: based on primary value creation (development or use of OSH) or secondary value creation (activities that support OSH processes such as funding or PR and or spreads knowledge such as workshops, lectures, etc) 

### Open source ecology

Paper uses a value creation taxonomy comprising artefact, processes and system structures.
