# Open Source Hardware Startupsand Their Communities

The conflicts that arose during Makerbot’s evolution show evidence for the socialdilemmas that are typical for commons-based value creation struggling to bal-ance on thefine line between collective provision and private appropriation (Benkler2006; Lessig2006; Hess and Ostrom2005).

tipologia relaciones entre communidades y firmas: Dahlander and Magnusson elaborate three types of relationships betweencommercial companies and open source communities that“often have an interest insharing with other members, rather than commercializing their output”(2005: 482).They distinguish between symbiotic, commensalistic, and parasitic approaches tocontrast different notions offirm-community relationships: In the parasitic notion,firms access OSS communities by engaging in joint development processes (firmgains/community gains). Commensalistic relationships are associated withfirmsthat align company goals and community interests on coexisting paths (firmgains/community indifferent). Finally, parasitism takes place whenfirms extract andassimilate developments from the community without obeying to its norms, values,and rules (firm gains/community loses).

We also observed a partial decoupling between the technical and ideologicalaspects. Though the technical achievements are considered as a relevant resourcefor all startups, the ideological embeddedness of founders differs significantly: someseek to develop their startups in accordance with the community and its values byonboarding and employing community contributors, others operate under amarket-based rational and do not reflect the community and its values.

With respect to their effects on product development and improvement, the roleof online communities differs within our sample. While well-received devices andwell-appreciated members of the RepRap community are broadly supported,RepRap newcomers proposing novel designs often fail to gain enough momentumand sometimes face harsh or unconstructive reactions from within related forums.Entrepreneurs intending to engage with the RepRap community therefore need toinvest in credibility and appreciation to receive actual benefits from theirinteractions

Analiza:
- modes of interaction 
    - Online interaction was appraised more isolated, autonomous, and even uncon-nected. Community members would work on a new hot end design and publish thefiles for the community when they werefinished—i.e., not during the development process.
    
- content of interaction (contribution, support, documentation)

- points of interaction: permanent FabLabs/hackerspaces seem to be a key meeting and collaboration space
    - working togetheron specific projects, meeting for organized workshops—e.g., printer assembly or3D modeling—and generally having“an informal way to talk and hang out”
