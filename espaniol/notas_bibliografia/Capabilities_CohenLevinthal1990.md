## Absorptive Capacity: A New Perspective On Learning And Innovation
### Cohen, Wesley M.; Levinthal, Daniel A (1990)

The ability to exploit external knowledge is a critical component of innovative capabilities

Ability to evaluate and utilize knowledge is function of prior related knowledge, including basic skills or a shared language. This confers the ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it and apply it. 

Bower and Hilgard (1981) --> the categories into which prior knowledge is organized, their differentiation and the links across them permit individuals to make sense and acquire new knowledge

An organization's absorptive capacity (capacity of acquiring new info and exploiting it) depends of that capacity of its members, though it's not only that. 

Interesting factors:

- Nature & distribution of expertise
- Communication with external environment (centralised/gatekeepers? decentralised?)
- Shared language & symbols
- Diversity of knowledge intra and inter-members 
- Depends on the links between members
