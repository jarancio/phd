# Development as freedom

The world has problems. Overcoming these problems is a central part of the exercise of development. We have to recognize, it is argued here, the role of free­doms of different kinds in countering these afflictions. Indeed, individual agency is, ultimately, central to addressing these deprivations. 

On the other hand, the freedom of agency that we individually have is inescapably qualified and constrained by the social, political and economic opportunities that are available to us. There is a deep com­plementarity between individual agency and social arrangements. It is important to give simultaneous recognition to the centrality of
individual freedom and to the force of social influences on the extent and reach of individual freedom. 

To counter the problems that we face, we have to see individual freedom as a social commitment. 

Achievement of development is
thoroughly dependent on the free agency of people

Not only is free agency
itself a "constitutive" part of development, it also contributes to the
strengthening of free agencies of other kinds. 

 What people can positively achieve is influenced by
economic opportunities, political liberties, social powers, and the
enabling conditions of good health, basic education, and the encour­
agement and cultivation of initiatives. The institutional arrangements
for these opportunities are also influenced by the exercise of people's
freedoms, through the liberty to participate in social choice and in
the making of public decisions that impel the progress of these
opportunities. These interconnections are also investigated here.

Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development, they are
also among its principal means. In addition to acknowledging, foun­
dationally, the evaluative importance of freedom, we aLso have to understand the remarkable empirical connection that links freedoms
of different kinds with one another. Political freedoms (in the form of
free speech and elections) help to promote economic security. Social
opportunities (in the form of education and health facilities) facilitate
economic participation. Economic facilities (in the form of opportu­
nities for participation in trade and production) can help to generate
personal abundance as well as public resources for social facilities.
Freedoms of different kinds can strengthen one another.

## Chapter 1: The perspective of freedom    
Expanding the freedoms we value  not only makes our lives richer and more unfettered, but also
allows us to be fuller social persons, exercising qur own volitions
and interacting with-and influencing-the world in which we live

the view of freedom that is being taken here involves both the processes that allow freedom of actions and decisions, and the actual 9pportunities that people have, given their personal and social circumstances.

The analysis of development presented in this book treats the free­
doms of individuals as the basic building blocks. Attention is thus
paid particularly to the expansion of the "capabilities'' of persons to
lead the kind of lives they value-and have reason to value. These
capabilities can be enhanced by public policy, but also, on the other
side, the direction of public policy can be influenced by the effective
use of participatory capabilities by the public. The two-way relation­
ship is central to the analysis presented here.

 Greater freedom enhances the ability of
people to help themselves and also to influence the world, and these
matters are central to the process of development. The concern here
relates to what we may call (at the risk of some oversimplification)
the "agency aspect" of the individual.

This work is particularly concerned
with the agency role of the individual as a member of the public and
as a participant in economic, social and political actions 

Individual freedom is quintessentially a
 social product, and there
is a two-way relation between (r) social
 arrangements to expand
individual freedoms and (2) the use of
 individual freedoms not
only to improve the respective lives but
 also to make the social
arrangements more appropriate and effective.

participation requires knowledge and . basic educa­
tional skills, denying the opportunity of schooling to any group--is immediately contrary to the basic conditions
of participatory freedom.
