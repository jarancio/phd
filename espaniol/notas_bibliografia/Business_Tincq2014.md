# Business models for open source hardware

Why can't FOSS models translate into FOSH models:

1. In FOSS the marginal cost of producing one unit is zero, in hardware not, even with fully automated processes - materials and space have an associated cost
2. Supply chains for FOSH involve multiple partners, organizational functions with different skill sets, across the globe
3. Quality & safety regulations apply to hardware

Value proposition: in OSHW it's much more than the produc itself (cheaper, more innovative, no parts sourcing product + know-how and experience + service + ecosystem and intermediation). This VPs can appeal to different customer segments.

## Model 1: Design centric

The most common model in open source hardware. The organization is focused on product design and R&D, while manufacturing is handled by another party.

- Case 1 : third party suppliers provide parts that the designer can sell assembled or, more often, as a kit (ex: OpenROV, Open Energy Monitor)
- Case 2 : a partner manufactures ﬁnished products that will be distributed under the brand of the project (ex: Arduino)
- Case 3 : a prospective model inspired by free software, envisions an ecosystem of manufacturers selling their own products based on shared designs managed by a open hardware foundation (ex: Wikihouse, Dronecode)

In this model, brand and community are key strategic assets. 

1bis: equivalent of dual licensing in FOSS, using CC-BY-NC licenses that only their creators can commercialize but enable other open projects (open core)

## Model 2: Manufacturing centric

In this model, the organization’s core value proposition is to manufacture and distribute open hardware products for an affordable price. In addition to the brand and customer community, industrial efﬁciency is a key asset.

Depending on the industry, the diversity and renewal of the product catalog can also be a key differentiator, especially in the ﬁeld of open electronics, of which this model is very typical (ex: Sparkfun, Adadruit, Snootlab, …)

## Model 3: expertise and experience based

This model is directly inspired from the free software industry, in which the most popular business model consist in monetizing expertise and service.

In Open Hardware, this can translate into:

- DIY Workshops to teach students how to make the product by themselves (ex: Tripalium teaches how to build the Piggott wind turbine)
- Selling not only a product, but also the “experience” of building it yourself, together with the project team (ex: Wikispeed)
- Consulting Services for companies to customize or build derivatives of your product (ex: Arduino) or learn your processes (ex: Wikispeed)

## Model 4: product-service systems (prospective)

The Product-Service System (PSS) model rose to prominence in 1959 when Xerox introduced the “pay-per-copy” printing model. It is now spreading throughout industries in the light of trends such as the sharing economy and the circular economy.

This model is still prospective in Open Hardware but has untapped potential:

- Data-driven Services for connected hardware / internet of things
- Subscription Model with spare parts for repair and upgrade
- Product As A Service to access it rather than owning it

## Model 5: standardize & leverage

One key product is opened, which serves to make the associated technology a de facto standard in the industry. Openness enables the firm to leverage other capabilities adapted to that standard.

e.g.: Android OS, Tesla motors opening its patents

## Model 6: platform model

Inspired by the platformization of the digital economy, the core of the value proposition is to organize an ecosystem of industry players (designers, manufacturers, resellers, customers, prosumers, brands, …) around one key open hardware technology or design platform.

Key examples in the open hardware movement include OpenDesk and OSVehicle, with an increasing interest from many project holders to adapt it to other products
