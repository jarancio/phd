# Building a Maker Community Aroundan Open Hardware Platform

Most studies of maker communities have focused on estab-lished, stable communities [8, 24, 26, 28, 44, 46].  Compar-atively little is known about how new maker communitiesemerge, partly because the identification of a group of peopleas a “community” can only be done with any certainty in retro-spect.

Our resultssuggest that open-source release is not itself sufficient for acommunity to form. 
Instead, we find that the ability to connect their development to other, established tools with their own communities is a powerful motivator for people to work and share their results. 
We term this case pluggable communities: distributed communi-ties of makers bound together by their use of a particular tool, where the communities grow in discrete leaps by connecting to other familiar tools, thereby leveraging their communities.

## Building communities

Crowdfunding  actions  can  facilitate **community  formation**. Product creators depend on their communities to secure fund-ing and increase the awareness of their work, and they rely oncommunity feedback to refine their products [14, 15]. Cam-paign funders (backers), beyond being interested in using theproducts, are keen to connect with a community, in helpingothers, and in support causes they trust [14, 15].

**Community sustainability** mostly depends onthe spontaneous involvement of its members to persist whenthe initial input from the developer reduces or vanishes

### Motivations

In FOSS:     
People contribute tothese communities for social and political reasons - defying economies of scale, allowing product viability without the ne-cessity of mass production, rejecting proprietary software and private property rights [2] - as well as to develop individual skills  and  share  knowledge  [17].   In  the  arts  domain, volunteer contributions complement or replace the actions of the original developers.

In making:     
contribution is stimulatedby the critical role that each member has, given the particularlyvaried backgrounds and skills of the members. Such a varietycontributes to transfer ideas across communities,  resultingin a rapid interdisciplinary skill building [23]. Among othermotivations,  makers  participate  as  an  opportunity  for  self-actualization [41],  to get inspiration for future projects,  toconnect with people in the community and receive feedbackon personal projects, and to educate others [23]

### Keys

Of particular importance for the sustainability of some makercommunities is a physical presence -makerspaces.
Learning in particular is facilitated by theawareness of colleagues’ expertise and competence which areco-situated in a particular setting [42]

Trainer et al.   [47] analyse the benefits ofsituated co-worker familiarity (a "multiplex understanding thatcoworkers have of their counterparts in relation to themselvesand their work together" [18]) in hackathons. Collocation isimportant for technical work as an opportunity to learn abouteach other’s interests and to watch experienced programmerscode to understand their programming conventions [47]

Including expert facilitation in these spaces is crucial to es-tablish creative goals and guide ideation, coordinate activities,and provide feedback [11]. The role of the facilitator is alsodevoted to "highlight key high-level characteristics or schemasexemplified by the idea, and provoke reconsideration of im-plicit assumptions about the design problem" [11]

Some  maker  communities  are  built  around  specific  open-source hardware or software platforms.
 Buechley and Hill [8] explain the success of the platform through how it enables makers to buildartefacts that were difficult to build before its introduction.They also focus on the distribution, adoption, and evolutionof a community around the platform. Their investigation con-cluded that the LilyPad community consists of people whobuild artefacts with the kit, who document projects, developand share tutorials, who develop modified LilyPad boards, andwho contribute to the online forum.  These activities in turninfluenced the evolution of LilyPad itself.
 
## Results

We suggestthat the growth of open-source communities is not always agradual expansion around a single tool; sometimes they growin discrete leaps enabled by connections between existing pop-ular tools, a process we describe aspluggable communities

### Design Factors Promoting Community Formation

- Designing for one specific andimmediate application can provide focus; designing general ca-pabilities based on hypothetical future use cases risks missingout on essential but non-obvious features or failing to providea unique selling point.

- Low barrier to entry, with openness to existing tools. Barriers toentry take two forms: setup time and learning curve.

A lesson for open-hardware makers is that open platformsshould allow future extensions that were not originally planned.These extensions might take the form of complete existingsoftware tools which have their own established communities.

- New hardware platforms succeed where they contributeto expanding the creative possibilities of the maker. We suggest that a new platform should havesignature fea-tures: simple, clear capabilities that go beyond what was easilyachievable before. 

- Our experience suggests that open-source materials are not themselves sufficient for a platform toattract a community. If Bela were open source but not easily connectible to familiartools, it is unclear whether developers would take the time tounderstand the internal operation of its code well enough tocontribute to its development.

### Activities Promoting Community Formation

- Crowdfunding success as cause (and effect) of community

Related work shows that crowdfunding helps establish a con-nection with a community [15] and build a user base [14]. Ourexperience supports these findings, but shows that the relation-ship between crowdfunding and community is bidirectional.

- Support to and from the community

Online forum is the primary hub for a geographically dis-tributed community to connect.
The public nature of the forum,though, means that others can learn from these interactionswhen they encounter similar questions.

Community members become both users and supporters:     
    - They offer support to each other
    - They introduce the platform to colleagues
    - They share similar interests, passions and concerns 
    
This spontaneous involvement is an important step towardcommunity sustainability.  The community is also currentlysupported by expert developers readily available to addressuser issues. Long-term sustainability of open-source commu-nities depends on reducing reliance on the original developers.

For open hardware, sustainability may also implyinvolvement of community members in the production anddistribution process.

Empowering users to map their knowl-edge onto a new platform enables a connection between twopreviously disparate communities.  This connection can befacilitated by so-calledsocial experts, i.e. mentors that enablea transfer of knowledge that can otherwise be quite difficult to perform [39].

## Conclusions

We find that technical merit, user experience and release ofopen-source  materials  are  important,  but  that  they  are  notsufficient conditions for community formation.

Instead, social factors play a significant role, including lis-tening to community needs and remaining accountable to thecommunity in all parts of design, development and delivery

We describe this mutually beneficial process of connectingexisting open-source tools aspluggable communities.
