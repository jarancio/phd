# Taxonomy of Hardware Documentation

Successful open hardware projects depend on successful documentation. Without easy-to-
understand documentation, a project cannot be reproduced. Without reproduction, a project cannot
grow or easily be forked. 

The goal of an improved documentation taxonomy is
that it enables anyone, at all levels of expertise, to study, reproduce, and improve open source
hardware projects.


## README.txt
The README.txt, or in some cases the product homepage, introduces the hardware through
documentation. Beginning developers of open hardware projects often rely on documentation the most
heavily. The landing page of your project, whether it consists of a website or a text file, is the place
you want to provide an overview identifying the following items:

- The project
- Licenses
- Attribution
- Expected time to build it
- Cost
- Expertise level

The README.txt should also include licenses and attribution information, which can sometimes
go hand in hand. 

This file is also a good place to record any warranty
information.

## Product Webpage

The webpage is a good place to redirect users to other services or resources around
the project that remain more active—

Community contact typically includes forums, an active community support list, or
versioning on a site such as GitHub for a codebase.

## Hardware Source Files

 For electronics, open hardware source files are commonly schematics and
board files. 

we must release design files allowing modification and distribution of the design files 


Examples of original design files include the following:

- 2D drawings or computer-aided design (CAD) files, such as those used to describe two-dimensional laser-cut, vinyl-cut, or water-jet-cut parts, in their original format. Example formats: native 2D design files saved by Corel Draw (.cdr), Inkscape (.svg), Adobe Illustrator (.ai), and AutoCAD.
- 3D designs that can be 3D printed, forged, injection molded, extruded, machined, and otherwise fabricated. Example formats: native files saved by SolidWorks (.sldprt, .sldasm) and Rhino.
- Circuit board CAD files such as capture files (schematics) and printed-circuit board (layout) design files. Example formats: native files saved by Eagle, Altium, KiCad, and gEDA.
- Component libraries (e.g., symbol, footprint, fastener) necessary for native modification of CAD files.
- Additional technical drawings in their original design formats, if required for fabrication of the device.
- Additional artwork that may be used on the device and is included as part of the OSHW release, such as an emblem or a cosmetic overlay in the original design format.

## Bill of Materials

Consider: 

- Consider suppliers that ship internationally or to multiple countries if you want a project that is globally repeatable.
- Pick suppliers that are dependable, have stock, and maintain an updated website with inventory.
- Data sheets, which come from the supplier, should be part of your documentation.
- If your project includes parts that are 3D printed or laser cut, remember to include those files and the correct licenses attached to them.
- If parts for your project can be pulled off preexisting products, include that information in your documentation.


## Tutorials

Videos and photographs should be used as a part of your documentation and for tutorials. Good visual
documentation can make a project visible and repeatable, which in turn can make it more popular. 

## FAQs

A good FAQ will cover the basics, from how to contact the primary developers, to the level of skill required
to start the project, the amount of time one can expect to spend on it, costs, and tools, to more detailed
information such as how people can contribute (in terms of development or other forms of capital). 

It might also cover troubleshooting and logistics such as shipping, contacting founders, testing, or finding answers to more
questions (e.g., Twitter handle, community forms or list, email contacts of the leading developers).

## Creating community 

Power users become sort of community managers, answering questions before the primary developers
even read them. Typically, you will want to introduce a group of “power users” as early as your idea
is born. It is not uncommon that these power users at some point join the primary development team.

Actively cultivate a group of people who could shape the
community in a direction that encouraged contributions, growth, questions, and answers.

These power users, members of the community who are highly knowledgeable and responsive,
represent the backbone of your community. They will often help shape the community in how it
approaches and how it builds the tools used, shape the project direction as a whole, and raise
awareness of the project to others whom you might not reach without them. In addition, their attitudes
can affect everything, so it’s important that you find people who are generally positive and helpful. I
also like to consider geographical location. 

Valuable
communities build valuable content, product support, and ideas. The community is the glue that holds
the hardware documentation together. 

Valuable content could be a simple blog post that someone writes about the project. It could be a
video, tutorial, or article. By creating valuable content that resonates with people and that they want
to share and engage with, you earn links to your site, answer frequently asked questions, and gain
social media attention.
