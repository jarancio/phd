#  Emerging Business Models for Open Source Hardware

## FOSS success
There is a large body of literature on the beneefits of FOSS over established development models (Deek and McHugh, 2008; DiBona et al. 1999) which describes
why firms would choose to liberate software-related IP and join collaborative and distributed development. 
The FOSS community has demonstrated through many successful software projects that, by facilitating participation in projects with little to no startup costs, meaningful contributions from the community can be made (Raymond, 1999; Lakhani and Von Hippel, 2003; Weber, 2004). 
Large-scale collaborations result in superior design with lower associated costs due to the continuous improvement, which leads more robust and innovative solutions to technical problems (Raymond, 1999; Soderberg, 2008). 
For instance, Android, an Open Source-based operating system for smart phones dominated the market with an 82.8% share in the second quarter of 2015 (IDC, 2016) and 97% of the world’s supercomputers operate on GNU/Linux (Vaughan-Nichols, 2014). 
Major Internet firms use and develop FOSS including, for example, Google (Google, 2015), Amazon (Clark, 2014), and Facebook (Facebook, 2016). The success of FOSS has created an alternative to expensive and proprietary systems by allowing for reduced research and development costs as well as more flexible design (Mockus, Fielding, Herbsleb, 2002).

## Hardware

Originally FOSS community members believed that Libre Hardware was challenging because of the nature of the design that was necessary to build physical artifacts
(Stallman, 1999), however, with advancements in digital manufacturing technology these views have changed (Stallman, 2015). 

(Gibb, 2014) ---> examples of libre hw communities

The trajectories of improvements and innovation are steeper (Foss and Pedersen, 2004) than they are for traditional manufacturing technologies

The number of libre designs have been shown to be growing at an exponential rate (Wittbrodt et al., 2013).
At the moment, most designs (for printed objects) are hard to copyright, and copyright laws can be bypassed through the introduction of small changes in the overall design (Bradshaw et al., 2010). Copyright is not the appropriate IP strategy for design files on any product that has utility (e.g. patents).
Therefore, YouMagine, Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, Github, Repables, Pirate Bay Physibles, Fab Fabbers, Cubehero, Bld3r, Thingiverse, Libre 3D and many other
repositories are blossoming (RepRap, 2016).

Categories potential users based on adoption:

- Type 1: groups that fabricate their own equipment using Libre Hardware designs in-house. Type 1 scientists will be referred to as a ‘makers’
- Type 2: groups that would be willing to pay more for equipment by having someone else fabricate for them. This would include well funded groups, groups on strict timelines, and those who lack appropriate staffing. For example, some scientific research groups, particularly those outside of physics and engineering, might lack the expertise to use Open Source tools to fabricate equipment themselves. 
- Type 3: groups that outsource their experiments to core facilities or businesses, and these organizations could conduct research for a fee. 
- Type 4: would remain with the traditional proprietary suppliers in order to continue to outsource their risk, which is one of the benefits of the traditional model.

### Business models
A business model describes the rationale of how a firm creates, delivers, and captures economic value (­Hedman and Kalling, 2003). 

Companies developing and distributing FOSS can not depend on their control of the source code for their business model, they rely on non-traditional models to provide sources of revenue instead (Krishnamurthy, 2005). 

In the Open Source context, the definition of business model can be made up of three components: 1) value (i.e. value proposition for customers and the business); 2) revenue (i.e. how the business can earn revenue, the primary focus of most Open Source business model research), and 3) logistics (Mahadevan, 2000)

#### Type 1: makers

a) Kit suppliers    
At the present stage of Libre Hardware development the majority of complex scientific hardware can not be fabricated solely by low-cost digital manufacturing tools, such as polymer-based single-material 3D printers ("vitamins"). 

For complex equipment, these vitamins may not be readily available or may represent a major time investment to source, thus there is a market for firms to provide all the vitamins for a specific tool in a kit form. 

b) Specialty component suppliers     
In the maker scientific community there will be customers who still want some level of specialization of their equipment beyond common kit models. Businesses can supply custom parts in materials that are not commonly available for digital fabrication in desktop 3D printers

For example, OpenBeam is an aluminum extrusion construction system that can be used to make optical rails (Zhang et al., 2013). Even though individual scientists could use the plans to make their own runs, the quantities they would need make it much more likely they would purchase the beams a few at a time from the original supplier, OpenBeam.

c) Calibration and validation services      
Businesses can service the needs of scientists either by shipping calibrated or valiated Open Hardware components directly or accepting hw for testing.

Although there are hundreds of open scientific hardware designs, only a small fraction have been formally validated and an even smaller amount are sold as calibrated units. As soon as the Libre Hardware community begins to offer this service, the cost advantage would help shift some of the scientific market to Libre Hardware. 

#### Type 2: open hw buyers

a) Selling open hw    
One can sell Libre Hardware either as pre-sales through crowd-funding services, through conventional “brick and mortor” retail stores, or e-shop sales. A good example of how this business model works in practice after the Libre Hardware business is mature can be seen in the success of Aleph Objects, which sells the Lulzbot Open Source software and hardware-based desktop 3D printers (Griffey, 2014). These printers can be used to make a long list of scientific tools themselves including test tube racks, centrifuges, and microscope accessories (Pearce, 2014).

Although anyone could fabricate a Lulzbot 3D printer using Aleph Objects’ plans, the cost and difficulty would likely be more than simply purchasing the device from the supplier.

In exchange for the risk of rival copiers undercutting its market, Aleph Object enjoys lower research and development costs and more rapid deployment of products to market because of the feedback from their users (Zimmermann, 2014). 
These substantial contributions or enhancements are offered with skills and costs that a single company would not be able to afford (Zimmermann, 2014). 

In addition to this model, there is also the possibility of a standard reseller business model.

The nature of collaboration in the Libre Hardware community also enables firms to sell products made with others. For example, Sparkfun is well known for collaborating with small companies and individuals to make new products. 

Firms can also follow a “package model” where they integrate Open Source components into their existing product lines. For example, a semiconductor characterization equipment firm could sell their own version of Backyard Brain’s micro-manipulator meant for neuroscience experiments (Backyard Brains, 2016) in their own larger characterization suite. 

Labelling: The Open Source labeling already has a strong positive connotation among many technology customers, and some have speculated it could be the next organic or fair trade (Gibb, 2014) label. Currently Open Source is becoming increasingly viewed as an ethical bonus as it has value to firms as good will. The Open Source labeling has already resulted in misuse and abuse by some companies that do not develop and release Open Source technologies however. The Open Source Hardware Association is trying to rectify the abuse by providing a certification program.

Similarly, a firm can open source the hardware they sell in order to expand the market of other parts of their product line. This is referred to as a “secondary supplier model” (Buitenhuis and Pearce, 2012), which is best suited for established and larger companies with more experience and existing patents. An example of this approach is used by the Nitrate Elimination Corporation (NECi), which is primarily a manufacturer of enzymes for green analytical chemistry. NECi recently collaborated by open sourcing a photometer, which radically undercut the cost of other methods to detect nitrates (Wittbrodt, et al. 2015). In addition to commercializing the photometer themselves, they released the designs under an open license to encourage citizen scientists, makers, and others to fabricate the
devices which would assist in expanding the potential market for their enzymes.

**Dealing with cloners**     
- Harness the Open Hardware community to out innovate the cloners. Sparkfun, a manufacturer of Open Source-based electronics, provides a good example of this model: by the time another business clones one of their boards and makes it available on Ebay, Sparfun already has the next version in the pipeline, ensuring that they always have a competitive advantage for customers. 

- Ignore the impact of cloners by focusing on services (see below)

b) Selling open hw services     
Sell expertise as the inventors of the hardware itself. Using this model, cloners are a net benefit as they ensure that the inventor’s hardware is more widely spread and thus expands the potential customer base for consulting and other services (e.g. RedHat).

**Strategies**     

1. Sell a subscription for a package of services around an Open Source product. This model would be particularly useful at large research centers for industry, government, or academia where there would be many pieces of equipment which need to be maintained.

2. Offer support and training which would include installation, operation, being “on call”, and acute maintenance for repairs or upgrades.  These can
either bring direct revenue (e.g. sale of a magazine) or indirect revenue such as it is used by Instructables, which extracts revenue from advertising. In addition, a firm can offer conferences, courses, certification, workshops, or training on how to build, use, and upkeep Libre Hardware. Open Source Ecology makes use of this model, for example, in their workshops (e.g. in aquaponics greenhouse workshop where participants pay a fee to take the mini course) (OSE, 2016)

3. Consulting for clients to make more sophisticated versions of Libre Hardware. original inventors of widely-adopted Libre Hardware are often the first to know of new improvements, derivative versions, and innovations. This knowledge can be an extremely valuable asset to be monetized in a number of ways. This type of service can also include guest lectures and corporate speeches. This type of service-based business model would match how university laboratories normally operate (grants not only for research but also for business)

4. “Producer coalition” (a coalition/foundation/or consortium model). Such a partnership could be commissioned by a group of manufacturers to solve a specific problem within the field (Bruns, 2001). There was a benefit to the firms to participate in the study as none of the companies were either able or willing to single-handedly fund such a comprehensive study individually. By working collectively under a carefully designed set of “memoranda of understanding” (MOUs), however, the study was created and concluded successfully (Andrews et al., 2013).

5. Support other Open Hardware firms in their development. For example, Seeed Studio is a hardware innovation business from mainland China which works closely with technology providers of different scales. When an Open Hardware firm has prototypes which are ready to iterate, Seeed helps produce copies from 1 to
1,000 or more using in-house engineering, supply-chain management, agile manufacturing, and distribution in addition to access to investors.

#### Type 3: outsourcers

Firms can  provide an online service based on Libre Hardware, e.g. perform experiments for scientists. Analogous to consumer platforms such as Etsy, Science Exchange connects core labs with scientists who need to run experiments (Gould, 2015). 

Having a hub for research institutions to find the right collaborators and pay for experiments in timely manner helps to monetize the existent bartering system, but also provides a solid platform for funding Libre Hardware development.


### Discussion

OHW advantages:

- By avoiding IP-based licensing models (e.g. involving patents, lawyers, legal fees, law-suits, NDAs and other secrecy agreements) Libre Hardware firms have substantially reduced legal fees compared to more conventional businesses. Today, many firms shockingly spend more on legal fees than engineering. For example, both Apple and Google spend more on legal fees than R&D (Covert, 2012)

- Libre Hardware companies often benefit from a large and vocal user community, which can significantly reduce the costs of product support because questions are handled in on-line forums by other customers (who are often producers themselves).

-  Open Hardware is easier for 3rd parties and other companies to create their own revenue streams by offering support for libre products. This makes
support faster, better and less expensive for libre products, which further increases overall value of the product. 

-  Libre Hardware companies can also benefit from better employees. There is already a relatively well established benefit for software developers who work for FOSS companies as their individual name can be associated with their work (Lerner and Triole, 2000; Marz, 2010). The same benefit for employees would be expected to occur for Libre Hardware companies

OHW limitations:

- the “prosumer” must be technically sophisticated to fabricate the products from open digital plans. Many laboratories do not have the necessary skills to do this effectively. In particular, labs may not have the equipment to perform validation and calibration, and the Open Source business community is not well matured in this area, resulting in holding back adoption for a wide range of sensitive instruments

-  self-fabricated equipment can be held back for not meeting regulatory, industrial, or consumer-quality standards. 

-  for larger and more sophisticated projects to develop a new Open Hardware-based scientific tool can involve a large investment whereas, as pointed out before,
funding agencies and for-profit entities are more comfortable funding proprietary development. 

-  there is real pressure for companies to pivot towards a proprietary model (case MakerBot) because the open models outlined in this article offer currently few examples of success

- making a project or product open does not guarantee a large community building upon one another’s designs. 

-  Having a successful project involves recruiting core developers, promoting and advertising a project (Vickery, 2015).
