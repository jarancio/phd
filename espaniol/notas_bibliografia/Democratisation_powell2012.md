# Democratizing production through open source knowledge: from open software to open hardware

The insights developed in the article describe the complex and dialectical relationships between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open source cultures and communities of practice limit the influence of these processes.

Within the software production industry, open source is broadly perceived as creating more democratic, ‘free’ and ‘open’ innovation structures. Following this, attempts are now being made to replicate the process in other fields of technology production, notably the production of designs for electronic hardware and other physical objects. 

**Analytical framework**:
I work from a constructivist perspective within communication studies where technological production (both materially and discursively) is considered as a site of knowledge transfer or exchange (Bowker and Star, 1999) and as an element of controversies mobilizing opposing social or cultural perspectives (Callon, 1981). 

Jasanoff describes how knowledge and practices are co-produced in these kinds of situations: ‘the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we choose to live in it’ (2004: 2). 

The expansion of open source is marked by boundaries that are delimited not only by identifications with different communities of practice – groups of people who share common interests and who inspire learning by doing (see Lave and Wenger, 1991) – but also by the function of the legal tools which the communities choose. 

Although this article broadly contributes to a political economy of ‘openness’, it departs from the primarily Marxist perspectives on labour sometimes employed to discuss free software and open source (for example, Bauwens, 2009; DyerWitheford, 1999; Hunter, 2004; Karatzogianni and Michaelides, 2009) as well as from
the liberal economic perspectives such as those of Benkler (2006), Lessig (2004) and Weber (2004). Instead, its constructivist perspective focuses on how knowledge-sharing and governing tools co-evolve along with communities of practice.

## Open source and participation
Previous research has suggested that collaboratively producing software code that is freely available for re-use creates more democratic production processes (Gristock, 2008), as well as more open cultures of participation and knowledge exchange (Lin, 2004). Downing (2003) argues that the open source software used by Indymedia collectives was a part of the movement’s critique of mass media. Similarly, Langlois and Dubois (2005) and Dunbar-Hester (2008) associate the alternative production of communications infrastructure like independent media and community radio with broader and more democratic opportunities for civic participation, with a critique of conventional mass media.

Despite these views of open participation structures as challenging to hegemonic forms of media, tension remains between radical reinterpretations of how knowledge or culture should be produced, and the co-optation of this knowledge by institutions such as the market. 
This is particularly evident within technical cultures, where new knowledge produced outside of hegemonic institutions such as the market can contribute to transformations in these same institutions. 
Turner (2005) draws a connection between computer technology, Californian culture and the emergence of cyberculture, while Bazzichelli (2008) traces a relationship between radical forms of net-art and the emergence of social networking sites and social media. 
Benkler (2006) considers ‘peer-produced’ knowledge as contributing to a transformation in the structure of value creation, in which the logic of scarcity is replaced with the logic of contribution. 
This raises questions about the extent to which characteristics of ‘openness’ especially the commons-based production characteristic of FLOSS have disrupted or reinvigorated capitalist modes of production.

GPL licensing establishes a process of governance that is self-propagating and outside control by the national, international and self-regulatory bodies that have in the past controlled the design, production and circulation of information infrastructures and knowledge (Mansell and Berdou, 2008).

This generative process is meant to democratize knowledge about software and software production itself, an assumption that has been extended from the radical free software process to open source processes in general. 
Still, the governing framework that is established by the social norms of sharing software products and the maintenance of ‘code repositories’ as suggested by open source has also made an enduring contribution to capitalism. 
As Weber (2004) identifies, major software companies are now core contributors to open source projects, recuperating the processes that hackers originally linked with radical politics – drawing on what Terranova (2000) calls ‘free labour’. 
This restructuring of the labour process in turn restructures knowledge: open source software developers maintain collective knowledge through code repositories outside individual institutional control. 

As software and hardware design converge, efforts are being made to develop norms for the production of open hardware design. These efforts reveal a different movement of knowledge and another set of expectations about democracy that are salient for considering the long-term socioeconomic impact of democratic production of media.

## Open hardware

Some cultural antecedents of these activities include the DIY and crafting cultures of mid-century America, where previously utilitarian practices became codified as leisure activities (see Haring, 2006) and the early techno-cultures of radio operation (see Douglas, 1987). 
Contemporary DIY can be divided into two broad types: utilitarian DIY, which is done out of scarcity of resources, and hedonized DIY, which is done for fun, often using commercially available electronic parts (Hertz, 2011).
Hedonized DIY is part of a broader ‘Maker’ movement that allows for personal expression as well as exploration of how electronic media work. 
The availability of micro-controllers such as the Arduino and the ease with which they can be used has been part of an expansion of this hedonized production, which in turn has helped to create a growing DIY electronics market, anchored by the O’Reilly company’s Make magazine and the annual MakerFaire festivals which O’Reilly organizes in New York, San Francisco and Nairobi.

Within this broad set of cultural practices, modifications of electronic devices and other physical artifacts related to digital media range from primarily artistic endeavours like steampunk (Onion, 2008), where elements of digital hardware are replaced in order to generate a nostalgic, yet high-tech DIY aesthetic, to projects that evoke a role for citizenship (Ratto, 2011), as well as re-engineering projects. This range of activities includes a variety of different relationships with the market: steampunk redesigns take place pri- marily outside of the market, civic projects might well be agnostic to the market, and some forms of re-engineering, for example the dismantling and reconstruction of hightech devices in the global South, create their own markets (see Wallis et al., 2009).

Hardware remains a material product with manufacturing costs.
Open hardware advocates note that these costs are dropping as many forms of electronics hardware are becoming software-controlled (Rubow, 2008), as simple elec-
tronic switches can now be printed or etched on to various materials, and virtualization software allows some hardware to be controlled by software, but other constraints remain. 
Material constraints, for example, include the fact that modifying the circuit board of a digital device transforms the device and its function, but does not provide its original designer with any knowledge or information about the nature of that transformation.

There are few means of identifying hardware objects as open-source, or of making the labour of hardware hackers visible on the devices they modify. 
This is turn makes it difficult to find space to challenge the existing regimes of intellectual property. 
How then can hardware hackers gain access to the equivalent of software source code? 
Various modes of organization have emerged, but these are mostly ad hoc and rarely develop shared norms of governance such as the free software and open source
licences. As a result, there is a variety of ways in which open hardware products engage the market (provides examples as Lylypad and Global Village Construction Set).

Pursuit of ‘openness’ and thinly democratic participation in producing both software code and electronics hardware detract attention from the more fundamental shifts occurring elsewhere: in ‘long tails’ of small-scale production of electronic devices for the educational market, in the black and grey markets for hacked
or otherwise re-engineered electronics, and through nascent attempts at Open Hardware for Development. 
Thus, a process to distribute open hardware is a necessary, but not sufficient step towards developing new modes of knowledge sharing that might characterize
an open design process.
