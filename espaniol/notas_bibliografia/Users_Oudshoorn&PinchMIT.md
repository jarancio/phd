### Innovation studies

In one of his first studies von Hippel (1976) showed how users innovate new products in the fast-changing scientific instrument industry. Von Hippel studied four families of scientific instruments: the gas chromatographer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometer, and transmission electron microscope. He examined how these instruments were first developed and how improvements came about. He found that it was often the users of these instruments who made the key innovations: “it is almost always the user, not the instrument manufacturer, who recognizes the need, solves the problem via an invention, builds a prototype and proves the prototype’s value in use” (von Hippel, 1976: 227). Indeed later in-depth studies of the commercialization of the tunneling electron microscope and atomic force microscopes (Lenoir & Lecuyer, 1997; Mody, 2006) confirm this point—such instruments are often innovated by start-up companies when scientists have seen a novel application and form a business to exploit it.

**BUSCAR YA VON HIPPEL 1976**

“Lead users,” often go on to freely share their innovations so that other users can adopt, comment on, and improve on them. Manufacturers in turn will often commercialize these user-driven innovations.

The model he develops, as is typical for the field of innovation studies, uses quantitative aggregative data. He combines this with the sort of case study methodology often found at business schools. (Von Hippel 2005).

Case studies of the European Information and Communication Technology sector (Williams et al., 2005) informed by the “social shaping of technology” approach (see below) have drawn attention to the importance of “social learning” in the innovation process. Such social learning is carried out by interaction between suppliers and users through the many diverse links in the innovation process. Much social learning, particularly for mass-produced consumer goods, is carried out through intermediaries (see below), which complicates the picture of flow from users to designers and vice versa.

### SCOT

Pinch and Bijker (1984) in defining the SCOT approach conceived of users as one of the “relevant social groups” who played a part in the construction of a technology. Different social groups, including users groups, could construct radically different meanings of a technology, known as a technology’s “interpretative flexibility.”

The SCOT approach specifies a number of different “closure mechanisms,” social processes whereby interpretative flexibility is curtailed. Eventually stabilization of a technology occurs, interpretative flexibility vanishes, and a predominant meaning and use emerges (Bijker & Pinch, 1987; Bijker, 1995a). 

Users, designers, and intermediaries can be said to share a technological frame associated with a particular technology, for example, electric lighting. The frame provides heuristics as to how users should interact with the technology such that the technology and user become part of a common “form of life.”

Kline and Pinch (1996) with their study of how a stable technology, the Model T automobile, could be appropriated and redesigned by groups such as farmers in the rural United States who turned their cars into sources of stationary power for washing machines, threshers, and the like for home and agricultural use. Kline and Pinch referred to such users as “agents of technological change.”

### FEMINIST AND PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES: DIVERSITY AND POWER

**For an overview of feminist studies of technology, see Faulkner (2000), Lehrman et al. (2003), and Wajcman (1991, 2004).**

Because women have been historically under-represented as innovators of technology and historians of technology often focused exclusively on the design and production of technologies, the history of technology came to be dominated by stories about men and their machines. Feminist historians suggested that a focus on users and use, instead of on engineers and design, would enable historians to go beyond histories of men inventing and mastering technology (Wajcman, 1991; Lehrman et al., 1997).

Cowan’s notion of the consumption junction, defined as “the place and time at which the consumer makes choices between competing technologies” (Cowan, 1987: 263) was a landmark concept. 

Cockburn and Ormrod draw an interesting distinction between “brown” and “white” goods as a way at getting at the gendering processes. Brown goods, such as VCRs, are designed, marketed, and sold to be fun and sexy for mainly male users, while white goods, such as washing machines, are designed, marketed, and sold in a more prosaic way for mainly women users.

The scholarship of the last two decades has emphasized women’s active role in the appropriation of technology (see Dynamos and Virgins Revisited, published in 1979, which included a section on “women as active participants in technological change” (Lehrman et al., 1997: 11)) 

Another key concept in feminist studies of technology is the notion of diversity. As has been suggested by Cowan, users come in many different shapes and sizes (Cowan, 1987). The very act of identifying specific individuals or groups as users may facilitate or constrain the actual role groups of users are allowed to play in shaping the development and use of technologies. Different groups involved in the design of technologies may have different views of who the user might, or should, be and these different groups can mobilize different resources to inscribe their views in the design of technical objects (Saetnan et al., 2000; Oudshoorn et al., 2004). To make things even more complicated, these different types of users don’t necessarily imply homogeneous categories. Gender, age, socioeconomic, and ethnic differences can all be relevant. Because of this heterogeneity, not all users will have the same position in relation to a specific technology. 

Feminist sociologists thus emphasize the diversity of users (see, for instance, the work of Susan Leigh Star [1991] on nonstandard users of information technologies) and encourage scholars to pay attention to differences in power relations among the multiple actors involved in the development of technology.

To capture the diversity of users5 and the power relations encapsulating users and other actors in technological development, feminist sociologists have differentiated between end-users, lay end-users, and implicated actors. End-users are “those individuals and groups who are affected downstream by products of technological innovation” (Casper & Clarke, 1998). Lay end-users have been introduced to highlight some end- users’ relative exclusion from expert discourse (Saetnan et al., 2000: 16). Implicated actor is a term introduced by Adele Clarke to refer to “those silent or not present but affected by the action” (Clarke, 1998: 267). 

Feminist sociologists suggest that the distribution of power among the multiple actors involved in sociotechnical networks should be approached as an empirical question (Lie & Sørensen, 1996: 4, 5; Clarke, 1998: 267; Oudshoorn et al., 2005). The notion of implicated actor has thus been introduced to avoid silencing invisible actors and actants and to include power relations explicitly in the analysis of user-expert relations.

### SEMIOTIC APPROACHES TO USERS: CONFIGURATION AND SCRIPT

Steve Woolgar has introduced the notion of the user as reader to emphasize the interpretative flexibility of technological objects and the processes that delimit this flexibility (Woolgar, 1991: 60). He suggested that how users “read” machines is constrained because the design and the production of machines entails a process of configuring the user (Woolgar, 1991: 59). 

"Designers configure users, but designers in turn, are configured by both users and their own organizations” (Mackay et al., 2000: 752). 

From this perspective, techno- logical development emerges as a culturally contested zone where users, patient advo- cacy groups, consumer organizations, designers, producers, salespeople, policymakers, and intermediary groups create, negotiate, and give differing, sometimes conflicting forms, meanings, and uses to technologies (Oudshoorn & Pinch, 2003). 

**Script:** Madeleine Akrich and Bruno Latour, in theorizing relationships between users and technology, use this term to capture how technological objects enable or constrain human relations as well as relationships between people and things. 

Akrich suggests that in the design phase technologists anticipate the interests, skills, motives, and behavior of future users. Subsequently, these representations of users become materialized into the design of the new product. As a result, technologies contain a script (or scenario): they attribute and delegate specific competencies, actions, and responsibilities to users and technological artifacts. Technological objects may thus create new, or transform or reinforce existing, “geographies of responsibilities” (Akrich, 1992: 207, 208). 

Dutch and Norwegian feminists have introduced the concept of genderscript to capture all the work involved in the inscription and de-inscription of representations of masculinities and femininities in technological artifacts (Berg & Lie, 1993; Hubak, 1996; van Oost, 1995, 2003; Oudshoorn, 1999; Oudshoorn et al., 2002, 2004; Rommes et al., 1999; Spilkner & Sørensen, 2000). These studies make visible how specific practices of configuring the user may lead to the
exclusion of specific users.

Emphasizes the reciprocal relationship between objects and subjects and explicitly addresses the question of the agency of users (Akrich, 1992: 207)

Akrich and Latour capture the active role of users in shaping their relationships to technical objects with the concepts of subscription, de-inscription, and antiprogram. Antiprogram refers to the users’ program of action that is in conflict with the designers’ program (or vice versa). Thus, the seat belt of the car is designed to restrain the user, but the user may have an antiprogramof refusing to wear the seat belt. Subscription, and its opposite, de-inscription, are usedto describe the reactions of human (and nonhuman) actors to “what is prescribed and proscribed to them” and refer, respectively, to the extent to which they underwrite or reject and renegotiate the prescriptions (Akrich & Latour, 1992: 261). For example, for a while in the 1970s some cars were designed not to start unless the car seat belt was  first fastened. Thus, a user fastening the seat belt is undergoing “subscription.” But if a user finds a way of fooling the car into starting without the seat belt being fastened (say, by jamming a piece of metal into the seat belt attachment), the user is performing “de-inscription.”

### CULTURAL AND MEDIA STUDIES APPROACHES: CONSUMPTION AND DOMESTICATION

**"Domestication:"** Roger Silverstone has coined this term to describe how the integration of technological objects into daily life literally involves a “taming of the wild and a cultivation of the tame.” 

Domestication processes include symbolic work, where people create symbolic meanings of artifacts and adopt or transform the meanings inscribed in the technology; practical work, where users develop a pattern of usage to integrate artifacts into their daily routines; and cognitive work, which includes learning about artifacts (Lie & Sørensen, 1996: 10; Sørensen et al., 1994). 

Roger Silverstone and colleagues have specified four different phases of domestication: appropriation, objectification, incorporation, and conversion. 

- Appropriation refers to the moment at which a technical object is sold and individuals or households become the owners of the product or service (Silverstone et al., 1992: 21). 
- Objectification is a concept to describe processes of display that reveal the norms and principles of the household’s sense of itself and its place in the world (Silverstone 1992: 22). 
- Incorporation is introduced to focus attention on the ways in which technological objects are used and incorporated into the routines of daily life. 
- Conversion describes the processes in which the use of technological objects shapes relationships between users and people outside the household (Silverstone, 1992: 25)

Most importantly, cultural and media studies inspire us to transcend the artificial divide between design and use. 

*See McCracken (1988) for an exemplary study of the symbolic work involved in appropriating consumer technologies. For an exemplary study of the emotional and social work involved in domesticating the Internet, see Bakardjieva (2005). Bakardjieva has suggested that “warm experts,” a term she introduced to refer to people who are already familiar with the technology and are part of the user’s life world, such as close friends, are important to facilitate the domestication of the Internet. Warm experts act as “an intermediary between the world of technology and the new user’s personal world (Bakardjieva, 2005). Other studies of domestication include Frissen (2000), Katz and Rice (2002), Ropke (2003), Schroeder (2002), Slooten et al. (2003).*


### THE BLURRING OF CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION

Douthwaite (2001), has developed an “innovation by users” model to analyze the iterative processes among users and between users and designers.

Eric von Hippel has introduced the concept of innovation user, or user/self-manufacturer (von Hippel, 2002: 3). Von Hippel argues that user innovation networks, which he defines as “user nodes interconnected by information transfer links which may involve face- to-face, electronic or any other form of communication,” can function completely independently of manufacturers (von Hippel, 2002: 2). 

Acts considered as resistance by promoters, mediators, and users are crucial aspects of the creation of new technologies and social relations (Kline, 2003). 

In modernist discourse, nonuse is portrayed as a deficiency and an involuntary act. Challenging this view, Sally Wyatt and colleagues reconceptualized the category of nonuse to include the voluntary and involuntary aspects of nonuse (Wyatt, 2003; Wyatt et al., 2003). Their preliminary taxonomy identifies four different types of nonusers: resisters (people who have never used the technology because they do not want to); rejectors (people who do not use the technology
anymore because they find it boring or expensive, or because they have alternatives); the excluded (people who have never used the technology because they cannot get access for a variety of reasons); and the expelled (people who have stopped using the technology involuntarily because of cost or the loss of institutional access).

These studies warn us to avoid the pitfalls of implicitly accepting the rhetoric of technological progress, including a worldview in which adoption of new technologies is the norm. This scholarship urges us to take seriously nonusers and former users as relevant social groups in shaping sociotechnical change.

An old and fundamental point in the sociology of science—that the main reward in science is producing something that can be used by other scientists (Mulkay, 1976).

This turn to users (and indeed intermediaries and mediation junctions [Oldenziel et al., 2005; Williams, Stewart, & Slack, 2005]) and their multiple identities is thus, as we have argued above, an opportunity to address within a single context issues and approaches that have often been pursued in multiple contexts and have spawned different bodies of literature. Users are no respecters of boundaries, and studying users forces the analyst also to cross boundaries.
