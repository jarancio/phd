## The “Problem of Extension” revisited: new modes of digital participation in science

> The paper argues that the digital shift changes 'The problem of extension'  [Collin & Evans, 2002] bringing it closer to the core of scientific practice, and provides a tipology for non-certified knowledge production and reception. Useful as a framework for assesing participation.

The institutional demarcation line between scientists and citizens is being put at stake [Jasanoff, 2003b], empirically challenged [Wynne, 1992] and analytically deconstructed [Collins and Evans, 2002].

'The problem of extension'= a call for greater participation leads to the problem of how can confidence in knowledge be guaranteed [C&E 2002]

The authors argue that following the digital shift the problem of extension now is closer to the core of scientific practice, as it enables new forms not only of production but also of reception.

Major changes brought about by digitalization [Haklay, 2013;
Wylie et al., 2014; Xue, 2014]:
- facilitation of links between amateur scientists (reciprocal visibility)
- enables public representation of research beyond circle of professional scientist to reach larger audiences
- increases means at disposal of amateur scientists (open source sw, hw)

Interesting references to Biohacking:
"With regard to biohackers, Seyfried, Pei and Schmidt [2014] have come to the
conclusion that prototypical forms of the opening up of science can be outlined, which are no longer focused on a safe experts/lay people difference [Seyfried, Pei and Schmidt, 2014]"

### Extension of the inclusion space to non-certified scientific expertise

*Expertise*: a general concept of expertise based on the well-versed participation in social practice [Collin & Evans] != *expert*, which refers to a particular social figure of experts as knowledge intermediaries and
mediators in fully differentiated scientific communities [Stehr and Grundmann, 2010]

Collin & Evans: sci&tech debates should involve those who can boast adequate expertise, no matter formal certifications ---> expertise as an objective feature of actors

Authors identify inclusion models with regard to expertise, attributed to the included actors, and use the following four levels [Colins & Evans, 2007]:

- contributory expertise: corresponds to a scientist in a particular scientific area
- interactional expertise:  enabling technical communication with experts of a given scientific area as well as informed decisions
- primary source knowledge: originating from the reception of scientific
literature
- beer-mat knowledge:  requiring only schematic knowledge which fits
on a beer mat

Q=  in what way new inclusion modes open the doors of science to people who cannot claim any certified expertise?

These are ideal [Weber] types, not found in pure form.

- Inclusion efforts can be differentiated according to the expertise deemed necessary for a given inclusion formal

- Inclusion efforts are typified according to the nature of the link to certified expertise (competition, where inclusion efforts from sci tend to be rejected, or cooperation, where they tend to be accepted)

### Tipology - Roles

a) Amateur scientists: inclusion of actor who claim *contributory expertise*. Competition with professional science is implicit.

> e.g. When biohackers style themselves as a more valuable alternative to commercialized molecular biology [Kelty, 2010; Delfanti, 2013; McQuillan, 2014].

b) Science participants: scientific literacy isn't a must, as the role is usually data collection (but not raising issues, analysis, interpretations). Associated to Citizen Science and scientists designing tutorials (*beer-mat knowledge*) so they can contribute. This category doesn't deal with the issue of citizens getting benefits from the activity or just being exploited.

c) Amateur critics: different kinds of *interactional expertise* is required here, in order to provide ex-post evaluations (cites? plagiarism? critical review?) in new available platforms

d) Research recipients: performed by online science recipients, anonymous public to whom *primary source knowledge* is attributed. Provide alternative means of assesing scientific performance (altmetrics)

a + d = complementary (require less expertise - assymetric cooperation with professional science)

b + c = competitive (require more expertise though implies symmetrisation of professional and non-professional roles --> institutional friction)

### New 'problem of extension'

New forms of knowledge co-construction irrespective of people's professional affiliation arise, blurring the distinction between certified and non-certified expertise

When the boundary is confusing, the problem has a new form: institutional certification, how is quality guaranteed?
