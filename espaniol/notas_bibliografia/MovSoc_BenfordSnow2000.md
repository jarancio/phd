# FRAMING PROCESSES AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS: An Overview and Assessment
## Benford & Snow, 2000

### Collective action frames

Movement actors are viewed as signifying agents actively engaged in the production and maintenance of meaning for constituents, antagonists, and bystanders or observers (Snow & Benford 1988). They are deeply embroiled, along with the media, local governments, and the state, in what has been referred to as “the politics of signification" (Hall 1982).

Framing: an **active**, **processual** phenomenon that implies **agency** and **contention** at the level of reality construction. 

It is **active** in the sense that something is being done, and **processual** in the sense of a dynamic, evolving process. It entails **agency** in the sense that what is evolving is the work of social movement organizations or movement activists. And it is **contentious** in the sense that it involves the generation of interpretive frames that not only differ from existing ones but that may also challenge them. The resultant products of this framing activity are referred to as **"collective action frames"**

collective action frames are action-oriented sets of beliefs and meanings that inspire and legitimate the activities and campaigns of a social movement organization

Not the aggregations of individuals attitudes and perceptions but the outcome of negotiating shared meaning.

### Features

1) Core framing tasks    
movement adherents negotiate a shared understanding of some problematic condition or situation they define as in need of change, make attributions regarding who or what is to blame, articulate an alternative set of arrangements, and urge others to act in concert to affect change.

Snow & Benford (1988) refer to these core framing tasks as “diagnostic framing” (problem identification and attributions), “prognostic framing,” and “motivational framing.”

a. Diagnostic framing:    
Injustice frames are very popular, identifying the victim of an injustice and amplifying the victimization. A common case. After this, comes the attributional component:  identification of the source(s)
of causality, blame, and/or culpable agents. Not necessarily a consensus activity (source of conflict)

b. Prognostic framing:    
Articulation of a proposed solution to the problem, or at least a plan of attack, and the strategies for carrying out the plan. 

Case studies reveal that the prognostic dimension is one of the primary ways in which a movement’s SMOs differ from one another.

c. Motivational framing:    
Development of a rationale for engaging in ameliorative collective action, including the construction of appropriate vocabularies of motive. 

2) Flexibility and Rigidity, Inclusivity and Exclusivity 

Collective action frames may vary in the degree to which they are relatively exclusive, rigid, inelastic, and restricted or relatively inclusive, open, elastic, and elaborated in terms of the number of themes or ideas they incorporate and articulate. Hypothetically, the
more inclusive and flexible collective action frames are, the more likely they are to function as or evolve into “master frames”

3) Variation in Interpretive Scope and Influence    

The scope of the collective action frames associated with most movements is limited to the interests of a particular group or to a set of related problems. However, some collective action frames are quite broad in terms of scope, functioning as a kind of master algorithm that colors and constrains the orientations and activities of other movements ("master frames")

Master frames are not central, or primary frame (Gerhards & Rucht 1992, Johnston 1991, Meyer 1995, Voss 1996). This type of collective action frame would seem to be more aptly referred to as an “organizational frame” (Evans 1997:454) or a movement-specific frame.

Only a handful of collective action frames have been identified as being sufficiently broad in interpretive scope, inclusivity, flexibility, and cultural resonance to function as master frames. Examples of master frames:

- rights frames (Valocchi 1996, Williams & Williams 1995)
- choice frames (Davies 1999)
- injustice frames (Carroll & Ratner 1996a,b, Gamson et al 1982)
- environmental justice frames (Cable & Shriver 1995, Capek 1993)
- culturally pluralist frames (Berbier 1998, Davies 1999)
- sexual terrorism frames (Jenness & Broad 1994)
- oppositional frames (Blum-Kulka & Liebes 1993, Coy & Woehrle 1996)
- hegemonic frames (Blum-Kulka & Liebes 1993)
- “return to Democracy” frame (Noonan 1995)

4) Resonance

Effectiveness or mobilizing potency of proffered framings. Two sets of interacting factors account for variation in degree of frame resonance: credibility of the proffered frame and its relative salience.

Credibility: 
- frame consistency (congruency between an SMO’s articulated beliefs, claims, and actions). Inconsistent if there are contradictions among beliefs&claims or among claims&actions. 
- empirical credibility: can the claims be verified vs reality? 
- perceived credibility: credentials, expertise 

Salience:
- centrality: how essential are the ideas to the lives of the targets of mobilization?
- Experiential commensurability: are framings resonant with target's everyday lives?
- Narrative fidelity:  to what extent are the proffered framings culturally resonant?
