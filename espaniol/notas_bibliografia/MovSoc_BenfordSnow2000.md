# FRAMING PROCESSES AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS: An Overview and Assessment
## Benford & Snow, 2000

Movement actors are viewed as signifying agents actively engaged in the production and maintenance of meaning for constituents, antagonists, and bystanders or observers (Snow & Benford 1988). They are deeply embroiled, along with the media, local governments, and the state, in what has been referred to as â€œthe politics of signification" (Hall 1982).

Framing: an **active**, **processual** phenomenon that implies **agency** and **contention** at the level of reality construction. 

It is **active** in the sense that something is being done, and **processual** in the sense of a dynamic, evolving process. It entails **agency** in the sense that what is evolving is the work of social movement organizations or movement activists. And it is **contentious** in the sense that it involves the generation of interpretive frames that not only differ from existing ones but that may also challenge them. The resultant products of this framing activity are referred to as **"collective action frames"**
