## Chapter 20: Science, Technology, and Social Movements (Hess et al) 

Researchers have examined how democratic participation in science and technology can be enhanced (e.g., Fischer, 2000; Sclove, 1995; Wynne, 1996)

Contribution of STS to social movements studies: 
- in general the central focus of the existing literature on social movements has not been issues of expertise, knowledge, and technology design. As a result, STS perspectives extend the social movements literature by bringing a sophisticated understanding of how the knowledge-making process works in science and how the politics of expertise and technology design play out in various political arenas

- A current in the STS field that developed out of reform movements within science that sought to link scholarship to partisan and activist goals (Martin, 1993; Woodhouse et al., 2002).The “reconstructivist” current can provide a helpful corrective to both the social movement and STS literatures, which activists tend not to read or use, by posing the question of how research that follows a social justice–oriented agenda is different from research based on a scholar-directed agenda. Just as social movements shape and are shaped by their environment, so social movement researchers shape and are shaped by theirs. The key question in movements for social justice is who does the shaping?

### Social movements study
Key features are:
- broad scope (unlike networks of activists or single campaigns), 
- extra-institutional strategies such as protest (unlike advocacy groups),
- a goal of fundamental social change (unlike interest groups),
- a challenge to elites or established organizations (unlike elite-based reforms and campaigns). 

Some social movements embody a challenge from socially or economically disenfranchised groups, but other social movements include diverse coalitions of people who share specific causes (such as breast cancer patients or open-source programmers). Likewise, social movements may seek benefits beyond the immediate  interests of their membership; examples include peace movements, human rights movements, and in many cases environmental movements.

**Contemporary social movement theory departs from one of three major traditions:     **
- Resource mobilization theory: focuses on strategy, agency, and organizations, examines problems such as building mass membership, competition among social
movement organizations, and growth trajectories. From this perspective, science and technology are viewed as one of many potential resources that a movement can access.
 
- Frame analysis: focuses on questions of meaning, the ways in which movement leaders must define issues to attract adherents, and the processes of frame diffusion (Benford & Snow, 2000). From the frame analysis perspective, science and technology enter into the ways in which issues are defined and made credible to potential supporters.

- Political process/opportunity theory: draws attention to the structural conditions that make it possible for social movements to mobilize, and frequently the studies adopt a comparative perspective (Kitschelt, 1986; McAdam, 1982; Tilly, 1978). From the perspective of political opportunity structures, science and technology can shape the conditions of possibility, including risks and hazards, that create spaces for mobilization and enhance or diminish the success of a movement.

**In the 1990s some leading social movement researchers developed a fourth, synthetic framework that brought together resource mobilization, framing, and political opportunity structures (McAdam et al., 2001): **    
The “contentious politics” framework shifted the focus of attention toward various processes and mechanisms that occur within and across movements and other forms of political contention.

### "New Social Movements (NSM)"

Theorists working in a continental tradition of social movement theory, which was especially prominent in the 1980s and early 1990s, drew attention to the change of goals, targets, and repertoires of post-1960s movements (Habermas, 1987; Melucci, 1980; Touraine, 1992). Different from older, class-based movements.  New social movement theory also developed another distinction—between state-oriented targets and non-state targets—that has been influential. 

Of particular relevance to STS researchers are movements that have non-state targets such as science, medicine, and industries (Moore, 1999).

New social movement theory provides a historical perspective on social movements by suggesting that they have changed in part as a reaction to the colonization of the life-world or because the central societal conflict has shifted away from class struggle to issues of democracy (Habermas, 1987; Tourraine, 1992).

### Mappings of Science, Technology and social movements

The triangle of science, technology, and social movements can be mapped according to the locus of change. 

- One locus of change involves reform movements or countermovements within scientific fields (Nowotny & Rose, 1979).

Much of the history of science documents those struggles and the displacement of one network by another, and the sociology of science has also studied such processes through research on specialty group formation (Mullins, 1972) and the dynamics of actor-networks in science (Latour, 1988).

Emergent research suggests that networks and research fields are sometimes connected to broader social movements, such as environmentally ori- ented reform movements within the natural sciences or feminist reform movements within primatology (Frickel, 2004a; Frickel & Moore, 2005; Haraway, 1989).

Research now underway is exploring the dynamics of “scientific and intellectual reform movements” and how social movement theory can be relevant to understanding them (Frickel & Gross, 2005)

- Another locus of change involves the adoption and reconfiguration of technology by social movements

Social movements’ use of the Internet is one of the few areas where the much vaunted but rarely realized “democratic promise” of the Internet is at least partially borne out. Web sites and listservs never sleep; they are available twenty-four hours a day to anyone who has the equipment and infrastruc- ture to access or post to them (Breyman, 2003). For example, the Internet has allowed the global women’s movement to become a truly transnational movement, not through an inherent politics of the technology but because the Internet can be used in both instrumental and expressive ways (Moghadam, 2005; Stienstra, 2000).

- A third locus of change involves scientists who enter the political arena, often in collaboration with social movements, to oppose policies supported by elites and advocate alternatives

The radical science movement’s critiques covered both political and epistemological dimensions of science, drew inspiration from some revolutionary societies, and proposed an alternative: people’s science (Arditti et al., 1980; Moore, 2006; Science for the People, 1974).

The tradition of social responsibility in science continues today, embodied in at least four major organizational forms (Frickel, 2004b):      
(1) boundary organizations (Guston, 2001), which are located in universities or government agencies and mediate scientific, political, and industrial worlds; 
(2) public interest science rganizations (Moore, 1996, 2006), which are located outside the government and overtly aligned with social movements; 
(3) professional scientific associations, which defend scientists’ autonomy, including that of dissident scientists, and sometimes take political positions (Moore, 1996); and 
(4) grassroots support organizations, which are social movement organizations, rather than organizations of scientists, that draw on scientific expertise to develop critiques of and promote alternatives to existing government and industry policies

Scientists’ concern with autonomy is frequently a source of tension between them and social movements.

Social movements today continue to be challengers, producers, and sometimes advocates of science and technology. Social movements challenge research priorities, professional practices, research methods, technology development, market developments, risk assessments, and public policy by renegotiating what counts as science for the purposes of governance. 

### Cases

The legacy of the appropriate technology movement today is, in developing countries, one of low-tech, locally controlled development projects, and, in wealthy countries, advocacy around renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.

The transformations of technology design involve a process of “complementarization” or redesign that adapted alternative, movement-based technologies to fit into existing portfolios of industrial production technologies and industry products **(Hess, 2005). **

Social movement activists have often made hopeful statements about the Internet, and some have suggested that its design, which is interactive and decentralized in contrast with broadcast and print media, is inherently liberatory. However, the Internet is also subject to political control (Privacy International and the GreenNet Educational Trust, 2003), and the relationship between the Internet and democracy remains a topic of empirical study (Fortier, 2001; Kalathil & Boas, 2003).

In contrast, other groups, including representatives of traditional social movements, developed a dystopian view of the computer, such as environmentalists
who saw them as sources of alienation (Hakken & Andrews, 1993; Kling & Iacono, 1988; Mander, 1984).

Unlike the Indymedia movement and community informatics, the “free/libre open source software” (FLOSS) movement is more oriented toward the politics of software
design, and its alternative code can be used by governments, corporations, and activists alike. The reform movement mobilizes volunteer programmers partly by offering a system of credit and recognition that has similarities to the scientific reward system **(Kelty, 2001)**. 

One of the key transitions (and divisions) in the FLOSS movement’s history was its reframing from the term “free software,” associated with activist
Richard Stallman, to “open source” and a more business-oriented perspective (Bretthauer, 2002).

In the open content movement (the provision of free information in the public domain, including scientific journal articles), conflicts have developed between copyright holders, especially media and publishing companies, on the one side and scientists, librarians, hackers, and consumers on the other **(Poynder, 2004).** 

### Questions

How does the science, technology, and movement interface vary across not only time but also space? To what extent do comparative differences become less
important as movements become more globalized? 

How can the study of science, technology, and social movements be configured in a way that is of value to activists? Does the goal require a shift in methods, such as moving toward participant-action research? Those questions return to one of the originary strands of STS, when portions of the interdisciplinary field were closely connected to scientific and technological reform movements.
