# Diversity and Distributed Agency in the Design and Use of Medical Video-Communication Technologies

In our analysis, the design and use of a new technology are intimately entwined. 

The notion of **script** is relevant to conceptualising the connection of design and use. Akrich () introduced this concept to visualise the way in which innovators’ representations of users shape technological development. In the design phase, actors construct many different images of users and objectify these representations in technological choices.

The very act of identifying specific individuals or groups as users may facilitate or constrain the actual role that specific groups of users are allowed to
play in shaping the development and use of technologies.

The inscription of representations of users and use in artifacts results in technologies that contain a script: they attribute and delegate specific competencies, actions, and responsibilities to users and technological artifacts. As such, technological artifacts – nonhuman actors – are not neutral actors in the socio-technical configuration, or “hybrid collective” to use Latour’s terminology. Like hu- mans, nonhumans can act, have intentions (mediated), can delegate, distribute responsibilities, etc. This symmetrical analysis of humans and nonhumans is one of the most important merits of actor-network theory and has
undoubtedly shed new light on the way technology configures practices (medical and other) (Pasveer and Akrich ; Lehoux et al. ).

Although the script approach, as developed by Akrich, is potentially adequate for our analysis, it tends to neglect the diversity of user groups involved
as well as the heterogeneity within these groups.Whereas Akrich briefly mentions that there is usually a variety of different user representations at work in
the design process, her semiotic approach does not provide any theoretical reflections or conceptual tools to acknowledge the heterogeneity within user groups and differences in agency between user spokespersons, nor does it specify explicitly how change might be accomplished.

**Distributed agency**: As actor-network theory suggests, agency is not an a priori given feature of an actor but is the outcome of interactions between the heterogeneous actors in the network. 

The notion of “distributed agency” emphasises that agency is not located in an individual actor, but is distributed among diverse (human as well as non-
human) actors that jointly form a collective actor (Gomart and Hennion ). Technological artifacts not only distribute agency among people and
things, they may also delegate agency to specific groups of users and not to others. 

Latour has tried to redefine agency/action to include nonhumans in sociological theory (Latour a, ) but failed, even in his own estimation (Latour b, ). Instead, we shall elaborate the concept of distributed agency empirically and discuss benefits/problems.

We consider distributed agency as a potentially interesting concept because it retains the valuable contribution of actor-network theory, that is, the symmetrical inclusion of non- humans and humans in sociological analysis, whereas two points of criticism of actor-network theory are obviated: that actor-network theory ignores differences among actors and that it pays exclusive attention to experts, engineers, and producers (Clarke , ; Star ).

How new technologies contribute to the equal/unequal distribution of agency over the diverse user groups. 

 Our research builds on a feminist tradition in technology studies where attention to users is important. The feminist concern has been, and remains, the virtually exclusive attention paid to experts in actor-network theory (“the executive approach”) which tends to preclude knowledge from the vantage point of non-standard positions, including women’s voices. Feminist scholars argue that it is important to include the “silent” and “silenced” voices of less-powerful actors than experts and producers in technology studies (Star ; Clarke and Montini , Clarke ; Saetnan et al. ).

We first describe the ways in which the script of the technology organises and structures the network in terms of the distribution of control and agency among the different actors, human as well as nonhuman, with a particular interest in asymmetries between the different human actors.

We continue by analysing the design processes underlying the development of this technology. What influence do the different user groups have on actual design choices?
