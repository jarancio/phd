# Collective Innovationin Open Source Hardware

Thisremix community allowspeople not only to prototype at a minimal cost but  also  to  work  on  projects  they  are  genuinely  interested  in (Acosta  2009;  Dougherty  2012). Participants free of the limitationstypically imposed by formal organizations develop products driven by theirowninterest.

At of the heart of this activity is remixing, the process through which community members modify or combine each other’s ideas. Such  a  remixing  process,  under  different  names,  has  been  seen  as  an integral part of innovation for many decades (van den Bergh 2008; Kogut and Zander 1996; Schumpeter 1934).  However, research  onthe  actual  mechanics  of  such processeshas  been  limited (Benner  and Tushman 2003)

Potential focal points for such research include understanding better the role of modularity in remixing(Fleming and Sorenson 2004), as well as understanding designdiversity (van den Bergh 2008), related to the expertiseand leadership  of the designers.

Thingiverse makes  it  possible  toobserve  novice  users acquiring  tacit knowledge while  interactingwith  experts (Miller  et  al.  2006).  It  is  also  possible  to see  how  and  how often the ideas areimplemented(Baer 2012)

In the platform, participants  link  their  designs  to  parent  designs,  creating  a  design inheritance network. 
Essentially, they remix other CAD files, drawing upon the work of others in order to producenew  work(Lessig  2008).  Their  links  are  direct  acknowledgement  of  the  information  they have used (for more on remixing, see Cheliotis and Yew, 2009).

We analyze:
- design inheritance
- similarity through shape comparison method (Kazhdan et al. 2003) modified for 3d printing files

Theinnovation  literature has  identifiedthe  not-invented-here  syndrome(Katz  and  Allen  1982),the tendency of people to reinvent rather than invent on top of others’work. 

Is this syndrome lessened or eliminated  by  using  remix  networks(Gupta  et  al.  2006;  Kyriakou  et  al.  2012)?  From  the  patent literature, and from other theoretical analysis we expect that remixing communities will create a norm of reuse, and that remixeddesigns will generate interest from other users (Fleming et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2010; Yu and Nickerson 2011).

One  possible  conceptualization  focuses  on  the product network as thecore. The products are linked to each other by inheritance links. The products also belong to a semantic network, the ontology of known product descriptions.
