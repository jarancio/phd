 
## WHAT IS A SOCIAL NETWORK?

A social network is a set of socially relevant nodes connected by one or more relations. Nodes, or network members, are the units that are connected by the relations whose patterns we study. 

Defining which **nodes** to include in a network analysis often poses an early challenge.

Laumann et al. (1983) identify three approaches to addressing this boundary specification problem.

- a position-based approach considers those actors who are members of an organization or hold particular formally defined positions to be network members and all others would be excluded.

- an event-based approach to defining the boundaries of the network looks at who had participated in key events believed to define the population

- a relation-based approach begins with a small set of nodes deemed to be within the population of interest and then expands to include others sharing particular types of relations with those seed nodes as well as with any nodes previously added.

These three approaches are not mutually exclusive, and studies will commonly use a combination of more than one approach to define network boundaries.

After researchers have identified network members, they must identify the **relations** between these nodes. These could include collaborations, friendships, trade ties, Web links, citations, resource flows, information flows, exchanges of social support or any other possible connection between these particular units (Wasserman and Faust, 1994).

Borgatti et al. (2009) identify four broad categories of relations: 

- similarities: two nodes share the kinds of attributes frequently studied in variable-based approaches. Group memberships (particularly co-memberships and interlocking memberships) are the only similarities frequently treated as relations by network analysts.

- social relations: kinship or other types of commonly defined role relations (e.g., friend, student); affective ties, which are based on network members’ feelings for one another (e.g., liking, disliking); or cognitive awareness (e.g., knowing). 

- interactions:  behaviour-based ties such as speaking with, helping, or inviting into one’s home. Interactions usually occur in the context of social relations, and interaction-based and affective-based measures are frequently used as proxies for one another.

- flows: relations based on exchanges or transfers between nodes

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF NETWORK ANALYSIS

- Relations, not attributes: causation is not located in the individual (education, race, income), but in the social structure or its position in the network

- Networks, not groups
