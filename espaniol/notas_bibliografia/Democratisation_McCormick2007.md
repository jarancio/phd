‘Scientization’ – the control of governmental deci-sion-making by technical experts and bureaucracy, where citizens have little influence.

Democratizing science is the processthrough which lay understandings are taken into account when scientificknowledge production is used to make political decisions.

democratizing science movements contest science, critiquing it as biased and politically driven

democratizing science movements can address a broad range of topics

 These movements can also have a broad range of goals: social jus-
tice, normative change, improved democratic practice, altering public
perception, and many others

Democratizing science activism manifests itself in a number of ways: contesting expert knowledge, re-framing science, making political claims, mobilizing scientific resources, and democratizing knowledge production. 

One of the primary methods of democratizing sci-
ence movements is to democratize knowledge production through lay/expert
collaborations – partnerships between researchers and activists for critiquing
existing science or constructing new knowledge. 

Activists can both value and be distrustful of science (Yearley, 1992), thereby dividing movement initiatives between criticizing or engaging in scientific developments. 

Politicizing consciousness is often a first step in social move-
ment formation. It involves creating a more political view about everyday
occurrences that can be developed into a movement framework for articulating
grievances. Social movement theory shows that the construction of move-
ment identity and movement consolidation is based largely around the politicization of an issue, turning what was once considered a personal
trouble into a public issue (Gamson, 1992).
