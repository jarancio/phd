# On the open design of tangible goods

## Open source beyond sw

In the scholarly literature, OSS is identified as anexample of a ‘new innovation model’ beyondmarkets, hierarchies, and strategic alliances (Os-terloh and Rota, 2007) that has also been referredto as the ‘community-based model’ (Shah, 2005),the ‘open source method’ (Osterloh and Rota,2007), or ‘opensourcing’ (Agerfalk and Fitzger-ald, 2008). Open source development is an exam-ple of the private-collective model (von Hippeland von Krogh, 2003) and one form of opentechnology (Nuvolari and Rullani, 2007).

To gen-eralise the ‘OS model’ to a non-industry-specificlevel, we propose the following model, which wecall Open Source Innovation (OSI): OSI is char-acterised by free revealing of information on anew design with the intention of collaborativedevelopment of a single design or a limitednumber of related designs for market or non-market exploitation.

This definition includes four critical aspects: 

(1) OSI is characterised by a non-market, non-contractual transfer of knowledge among theactors involved in invention and between thoseactors and those involved in exploitation. Actorsshare some ideas, designs, and other relevantinformation with a non-definite set of other actorswithout any immediate recompense or expecta-tion thereof. An open licence may establish rulesof knowledge sharing and re-usage.

(2) Actors share  their ideas with  the clear  purpose  ofcontributing to the joint development of 

(3) a single, integrated design or a number of interrelated designs. Put reversely, OSI does not referto design information being revealed by actorswithout the understanding that this design is apart of a larger design task carried out in acollaborative fashion by a group of actors. 

(4) The design thus developed is exploited in thesense that it is produced and sold on a market,integrated into other products that are marketed,deployed during the development of such pro-ducts or used for any other private or commercialpurpose

Our model builds on and intersects with severalof the models of collaborative development pro-posed in the literature (cf. Raasch et al., 2008).The theoretical foundation supporting OSI is laidby the private-collective model (von Hippel andvon Krogh, 2003, 2006), whereby actors investprivate resources towards the production of apublic good. Within this model, OSI focuses ona collaborative development process involvingseveral contributing actors and therefore requir-ing organisational mechanisms to co-ordinate theefforts expended by different actors.

OSI also needs to be related to user innovationnetworks or communities (von Hippel, 2005, 2007;Fu ̈ller et al., 2007). The user-innovation model isbased on ‘open, voluntary, and collaborative ef-forts of users’ (Shah, 2005, p. 1), meaning privateor commercial, but still users. Similarly, OSI canbe generated by commercial or private contribu-tors or a mixture of both. Contributors to OSI,however, need not be users. Commercial contribu-tors, for instance, may profit from an increase insales of complementary products or the creation ofa standard (Henkel, 2006). Moreover OSI refers tocollaborative development efforts on behalf of anintegrated design, a condition that does not neces-sarily hold for user communities (Lu ̈thje et al.,2005).
