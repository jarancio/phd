# Shifting Innovation to Users via Toolkits

In this emerging new approach, manufacturers actuallyabandontheir increasingly frustrating efforts to under-stand users’ needs accurately and in detail. Instead,they outsource keyneed-relatedinnovation tasks to theusers themselves after equipping them with appropri-ate “toolkits for user innovation.”

Toolkits for user innovation are coordinated setsof “user-friendly” design tools that enable users todevelop new product innovations for themselves. Thetoolkits are not general purpose. Rather, they are spe-cific to the design challenges of a specific field orsubfield, such as integrated circuit design or soft-ware product design. Within their fields of use, theygive users real freedom to innovate, allowing themto develop producible custom products via iterativetrial and error. 

## Toolkits and sticky information

The toolkits approach to product and service develop-ment involves transferringneed-relatedproduct devel-opment tasks from manufacturers to users, and equip-ping the users with tools to carry out those tasks.

To solve a problem, needed information and problem-solving capabilities (also a form of informa-tion) must be brought together at a single locus. Therequirement to transfer information from its pointof origin to a specified problem-solving site will notaffect the locus of problem-solving activity when thatinformation can be shifted at little or no cost. How-ever, when it is costly to transfer from one site toanother in useable form—it is, in our terms, sticky—the distribution of problem-solving activities can besignificantly affected.

Information stickiness can be due to attributesof the information itself, such as the way it is encoded(Nelson 1982, 1990; Pavitt 1987; Rosenberg 1982).In addition, it can be due to attributes of informa-tion seekers or providers. 

For example, a particu-lar information seeker may be less able in acquir-ing information because of a lack of certain toolsor complementary information—a lack of “absorptivecapacity” in the terminology of Cohen and Levinthal(1990). 

Also, specialized personnel such as “techno-logical gatekeepers” (Allen 1984, Tushman and Katz1980, Katz 1997) and specialized organizational struc-tures such as information transfer groups (Katz andAllen 1988) can significantly affect information trans-fer costs between and within organizations.

The toolkits approach to product and service devel-opment reduces sticky information transfer costs byrepartitioning the overall product development taskinto subtasks, each primarily requiring informationfrom either the user or the manufacturer site. Then it assigns each subtask to user- or manufacturer-basedproblem solvers as appropriate.

Once problem solving and the sticky informationneeded to perform it have been colocated, the devel-opment of new products and services can proceedmuch more rapidly and effectively.

When taskshave been subdivided so that the sticky informationrequired to solve them and the problem solvers are colocated, the need to shift problem solving back andforthbetweenuser and manufacturer during the trialand error cycles involved in learning by doing iseliminated. Iterative learning by doing is still carriedout, but the trial-and-error cycles for each subtaskare carried out entirelywithina user or manufacturerfirm.

## Toolkits—A Way to Transfer Design Capability to Users

Toolkit development involves “unsticking” man-ufacturer solution and production information rel-evant to the development work of user-innovatorsand incorporating it into a toolkit. 

The higher the heterogeneity of userneeds faced by a manufacturer, the higher its incen-tive to invest in unsticking problem-related informa-tion relevant to user problem solvers and transfer thatinformation to users in the form of a toolkit for userinnovation (von Hippel 1998).

We propose that effective toolkits for user inno-vation will enable five important objectives. 

1. First,they will enable users to carry out complete cyclesof trial-and-error learning. 
2. Second, they will offerusers a “solution space” that encompasses the designsthey want to create. 
3. Third, users will be able tooperate them with their customary design languageand skills—in other words, well-designed toolkits are“user friendly” in the sense that users do not need toengage in much additional training to use them com-petently. 
4. Fourth, they will contain libraries of com-monly used modules that the user can incorporateinto his or her custom design, thus allowing the userto focus his or her design efforts on the truly uniqueelements of that design. 
5. Fifth and finally, properly designed toolkits will ensure that custom products and services designed by users will be producible on manufacturer production equipment without requir-ing revisions by manufacturer-based engineers.

## Conclusions

Toolkits will not be the preferred approach whenthe highest achievable performance on other dimen-sions is required, because they incorporate automateddesign rules that cannot, at least at present, translatedesigns into products or software with the same skillas can a human designer.

The manufacturer does still have to know the solution space his customersrequire to be able to design the novel products orservices they want.

Manufacturer-based developers can create a first-generation toolkit by analyzing existing customerproducts and determining the dimensions that wererequired to design those. Alternatively, manufacturerscan simply modify existing in-house design toolsetsto make them more user friendly, and distribute theseas a first-generation toolkit for user innovation.
