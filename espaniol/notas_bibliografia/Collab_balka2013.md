# The Effect of Selective Openness on Value Creation in UserInnovation Communities

Goal: investigate  how community members’ perceptions of selective openness affect their contributions to an innovation project.

Findings: openness indeed increases community members’ involve-ment in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of opennessstrongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that,at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal valuecapture is softer than hitherto understood. 

## Background

Online innovation communities havebecome   a   particular   focus   of   research   (Fuchs   andSchreier, 2011; Nambisan and Baron, 2009; von Krogh,Spaeth,  and  Lakhani,  2003).  Propelled  by  advances  indigital  communication  technology,  communities  haveproliferated across many industries and have become richsources  of  innovation  (Franke  and  Shah,  2003;  Füller,Matzler, and Hoppe, 2008). They often consist of users,but  may  also  include  other  parties  (Baldwin  and  vonHippel, 2011).

Three different arche-typalforms of opennessare distinguished: transparency(West  and  O’Mahony,  2008), accessibility  (West  andO’Mahony, 2008), and replicability (Balka et al., 2010).

-  Transparency incorporates two distinct aspects: thepossibilityand therightto  “look”  at  the  design  (Stuermer,  Spaeth,  andvon  Krogh,  2009).  ---> Observation, Feedback

- Acces-sibility is defined as thepossibilityand therightfor thecommunity  to  access  and  modify  design  information(West and O’Mahony, 2008). ---> Codevelopment

- Replicabilitythen is defined as thepossi-bilityand therightof the community to produce instan-tiations of (parts of) the design. Replicability is createdby  the  availability  of  individual  components  (either  bymaking or by buying), the provision of requisite informa-tion  about  the  design  layout  and  assembly,  and  by  theabsence  of  legal  barriers  impeding  self-production  orself-assembly.   ---> Coproduction

# Methodology 

Our  findings  rely  on  self-reported  data,  collected  atone  particular  point  in  time.  Such  self-ratings  are  themost  common  method  of  collecting  data  in  social  sci-ences  (Malhotra,  Kim,  and  Patil,  2006),  and  have  beenemployed  extensively  in  user  innovation  research  (e.g.,Franke et al., 2006; Schreier and Prügl, 2008). Still, theycreate a risk of common method bias and preclude con-clusive proof of causality. As explained, our survey wasdesigned  specifically  to  guard  against  common  methodbias. In their related study, von Krogh et al. (2009) verifythe   validity   of   self-reported   hours   contributed   as   ameasure of effort by comparing it with objective commu-nity activity data, and find a satisfactory correlation.

# Results

The  model  generally  supports  ourhypotheses  that  openness  positively  affects  perceivedinvolvement.   Our   hypotheses   are   supported   only   inrelation  to  the  openness  of  the  software  component,however. Transparency, accessibility, and replicability ofsoftware   enhance   community   members’  involvementin  the  project;  a  similar  effect  for  hardware  cannot  bedemonstrated
