# The Effect of Selective Openness on Value Creation in UserInnovation Communities

Goal: investigate  how community members’ perceptions of selective openness affect their contributions to an innovation project.

Findings: openness indeed increases community members’ involve-ment in the innovation project and their contributions to it. Interestingly, however, some forms and loci of opennessstrongly affect community perceptions and behavior, while others have limited or no impact. This finding suggests that,at least in relation to user communities, the trade-off that firms face between external value creation and internal valuecapture is softer than hitherto understood.
