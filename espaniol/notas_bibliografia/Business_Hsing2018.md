### On Moore's Law

Historically,  big  technol-ogy  companies  dominated  the  market  because  only  they  had  the  scale  and  resources  to  not  only  produce  increas-ingly performant products, but also to keep up with them. However, with the slowing of performance increases, there is a widening window for other innovators to create new products before a new generation of processors make them obsolete. A profound implication is that there may be less demand for new products, concurrent with a ‘rise in repair culture  as  technology  becomes  less  disposable  and  more  permanent’. Huang contends that this will create an open-ing  for  open  hardware  and  small  businesses.   

### On collaboration in hw
First,  the  book’s  practical  advice  on  manufacturing  is  not  only  useful  when  bringing  products  to  market,  but  also  serves  as  a  reminder  that  sharing  should  go  above  the  source  code  level.  By  documenting  know-how  rang-ing  from  the  level  of  detail  needed  in  a  bill  of  materials,  the  need  to  create  a  test  rig  to  accompany  a  product,  or  bridging  language  and  cultural  barriers,  Huang  gives  a  multi-faceted  overview  of  the  complexities  that  go  into  collaborative open hardware development.
