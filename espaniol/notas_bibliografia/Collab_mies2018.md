# Harnessing the Synergy Potential of OpenSource Hardware Communities

The aim of this article is to explain to managers how they can navigatetheir companies to participate within OSH communities.

The phenomenon of OSH can nowadays mainly be observed in grassrootsinitiatives but also in emerging businesses such as start-ups and small enterprises.
Some medium-size enterprises have built their operations on OSH, especially in thesupply market for makers.
OSH also raised interest of larger industrial players as exemplified by the automotive industry.

Companies can draw a multitude of advantages fromengaging in open source environments regarding the three aspects: technology,people, and process development (Aksulu & Wade,2010):

- Technology: greatly reduced R&D, patenting,and licensing costs; cutting out the middlemen through direct sourcing andcrowdfunding are significant components of OSH-related business models
- People: widening networks within OSH environments, opportunities for talent recruiting
- Process development:  Q&A-based help and troubleshooting forums, tutorials for makers, extensive design libraries,marketplaces for direct sourcing of products and parts, customization servicesfor application-specific designs, offerings of independent aftermarket services,consultancy, assembly workshops, training, etc.

Two types of hardware products can be considered depending on their complexity: 

- Either by 'home engineers' enabled by boom of 3D printing, platforms as Thingiverse (around 900.000 uploads), one-person-objects or a sequential series of remaking and forking. 

- collaborative development of complex products, involving several contributors in parallel. More than 200 products or devel-opment projects of this type have been identified, covering product categories suchas machine tools, vehicles, power supply as well as robotics, agricultural, medical,and laboratory equipment.

## Open Source Hardware Lifecycle

Two options:

- Public innovation (reveal the result of aproduct development projectperformed in a private setting)
- Open source product development (release of already public documents community-developed, in a stable version.)

At this time of the development of the phenomenon of OSH, it seems publicinnovation largely outweighs open source innovation.
This is the result of challenges inthe building of OSH communities around OSPD processes which are addressed inthe following paragraphs.

## Open source hardware communities
OSHcommunities are socially formed groups of heterogeneous agents and actors whoco-create OSH products. 
Within them, geographically dispersed contributors arecoordinated in online platforms by a core team. 

Developers, users and followers gravitate around the core team (Ye & Kishida,2003), therefore the social model of open source communities is also commonly referred to as onion model. 
Due to their loosely coupled structures and fluid boundaries, participation levels vary overtime in terms of quantity as well as content.

Participants may engage as followers, replicators, developers, or community managers, among other roles. 
They proactively self-organize and choose their own roles as well as the period of their involvement. 
Within open source environments, actors are not connected through organizational affiliation (Aksulu & Wade,2010) but rather contribute as individuals.

## Open Source Product Development Process
OSPD projects aim to create the momen-tum for distributed work in OSH communities as the primary source of value creation. 
This organization of work is relevant for the development of complex physical products which are dependent on the provision of inputs from several people in a collaborative setting. 
OSPD thus fosters collaboration towards needs-based problem solving within self-organized processes that span all design phasesfrom conception to manufacturing. 
 
OSPD processes are internet-based and requirethe use of group ware as well as social media to support data management and communication, which are in turn required for effective collaboration, continuityof work, and acquisition of new members. 
A critical element to the structuration of OSPD operations is the use of a data management versioning systems to facilitate contributions.
 
## Open Source Product Development Process Model

Version control systems enable OSPD projects to evolve task-by-task, without a predetermined agenda, as a collection of contributions in which each contribution immediately furthers the course of action of the project.
Progress is achieved through an iterative and ideally self-organized process involving the following four sets of activities: 

- (i) task definition and assignment, 
- (ii) taskcontribution and validation (feedback and review), 
- (iii) integration of stableversions,
- (iv) continuous product-related documentation

Tasks are defined and logged in modular issue lists, where they can beself-selected(jargon for claiming) or suggested to project contributors. It is, however,common-place that core teams shoulder the lionâ€™s share of the work effort.

Reviewing is usually performed by core team members, who either accept orreject them.

Several iterations can be made until acceptance is given. As an integral part of allthese activities, appropriate technical documentation needs to be carried out contin-uously. 

Tasks are never closed, only their priority changes. It is acharacteristic of OSPD processes that they are not completed when a stable productversion is reached, rather, they remain subject to perpetual improvement (Bonvoisin& Boujut,2015)
