# Scaffolding Creativity with Open-Source Hardware 

## MODES OF CREATION 

### Making 
Making  the  physical  object  from  its  digital  design  file. 

In  making  objects  from  design  files,  individuals  gain  a  better  appreciation  of  what  they're  are  made  of,  how  they're  put  together,  and  how  they  work.  


### Personalizing

Simple modifications that may not effect  the  device's  functionality  or  overall  design  but  that  create  a  personal  connection  between  the  object  and  its  maker.        

### Designing

This process is aided by the ability to use  the  original  design  as  a  template  for  the  new  form,  maintaining  those  aspects  required  for  the  assembly  or  functioning  of  the  object.

### Engineering

Encourages   technical   exploration   and  learning  by  placing  it  within  a  context  (the  particular  design)  that  motivates  and  inspires  new  abilities. 

### Experimenting

Different uses, logics, materials. perceptions. 

## COMPARISON WITH OTHER APPROACHES 

Compared  with  construction  kits,  for  example,  it  offers  more  flexibility  in  both  design  and  function as individuals  arenâ€™t constrained to the system created by the maker of the toolkit.      

Additionally,  when  you  make  something  based  on  open-source hardware, it serves as a new master design or model, rather than a patch to or assemblage of other designs.
This means  that  changes  and  improvements  can  be  shared  with  and  further  modified  by  others,  or integrated  back  into  the  original design, in ways that are difficult or impossible with construction kits.

Open-source  hardware  also  allows  an  individual  to  easily  retain portions of an existing design, allowing them to focus their  creativity  on  those  aspects  of  most  importance  to  them. 

Digital  fabrication  facilitates  the  scaling  of  open-source hardware design to larger volume production, as the original  design  files  can  be  reproduced  automatically,  in  contrast to craft approaches.
