## Snow et al - Frame Alignment Processes, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation

Frame alignment processes, of one variety or another, are a necessary condition for movement participation

### 1-Frame bridging:     
the linkage of an SMO with what McCarthy (1986) has
referred to as unmobilized sentiment pool. This means,  aggregates of individuals who share common grievances and attributional orientations, but who lack the organizational base for expressing their discontents and for acting in pursuit of their interest

Main strategies: organizational outreach, info diffusion through interpersonal or intergroup networks, bridging

### 2- Frame amplification:    
the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem or set of events

Because the meaning of events and their connection to one's immediate life situation are often shrouded by indifference, deception or
fabriction by others, and by ambiguity or uncertainty (Goffman, 1974), support for and participation in movement activities is frequently contingent on the clarification and reinvigoration of an interpretive frame.

**a) Value amplification:** dentification, idealization, and elevation of one or more values presumed basic to prospective constituents but which have not inspired collective action for any number of reasons.  (Values = modes of conduct or states of existence that are thought to be worthy of protection and promotion, usually hierarchical) 

Why not mobilized?     
-They may have atrophied,      
-fallen into disuse,     
-have been suppressed because of the lack of an opportunity for expression due to a repressive authority structure (Tilly, 1978)     
-the absence of an organizational outlet (McCarthy, 1986);     
-they may have become taken for granted or cliched (Zijderveld, 1979);    
-they may not have been sufficiently challenged or threatened (Turner and Killian, 1972);    
-their relevance to a particular event or issue may be ambiguous (Goffman, 1974)

Main strategies: focusing, elevation, and reinvigoration of values relevant to the issue or event being promoted or resisted

**b) Belief amplification:** (Beliefs: ideational elements that cognitively support or impede action in pursuit of desired values) 

(1) the seriousness of the problem, issue, or grievance in question     
(2) the locus of causality or blame     
(3) stereotypic beliefs about antagonists or targets of influence (create an enemy)    
(4) the probability of change or the efficacy of collective action (echoes from past successful fights - such beliefs or expectancies are temporally variable and can be modified during the course of actual participation and by the micromobilization efforts of SMOs as well)    
(5) the necessity and propriety of "standing up"  (moral propriety, loyalty and responsibility, properties of cultural codes or belief systems and
not merely individual attributes)

### 3- Frame extension:    
more may be involved in securing and activating participants than overcoming ambiguity and uncertainty or indifference and letharge - a SMO may extend the boundaries of its primary framework so as to encompass interests or points of view that are incidental to its primary objectives but of considerable salience to potential adherents (e.g. anti racism in peace mov)

Participation changes over time: the interests associated with participation were frequently redefined or elaborated. The longer the member's tenure, the more likely he or she would articulate interest in world conditions and peace rather than in material or physiological matters, which was typically the case with novitiates. Frame extension is used sometimes as a "hook".

### 4- Frame transformation:    
the programs, causes, and values that some SMOs promote may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames. New values may have to be planted and nurtured, old meanings or understandings jettisoned, and erroneous beliefs or "misframings" reframed (Goffman, 1974:308) in order to garner support and secure participants

**a) transformations of domainspecific frames:** selfcontained but substantial changes in the way a particular domain of life (diet, leisure, work, whatever) is framed - e.g. de-normalize some behaviour, as in feminism (required for dramatic changes)

**b) transformations of global interpretive frames:** immediate, total change (religious). The strategie is to affect conversion by "keying" the  experiences of prospective participants, including events that they observe, so that what is going on for them is radically reconstituted 

What changes? 
The perceived seriousness (b1), sth that wasn't so terrible now is intolerable and an injustice;    
The blame, a shift in the attribution of the root cause

==========
There is a kind of elective affinity between forms of alignment and movement goals and perspective 

Frame bridging, for example, appears to be the modal type of alignment associated with low demand, professional social movements that often are difficult to distinguish from conventional interest groups.

Value amplification might be hypothesized as the modal type of alignment associated with two sets of movements: those that are reactive in the sense that they defend the status quo, such as many conservative movements; and those that arise among people who are segmentally organized in relation to dominant power structure

Why important? The argument here is that the reasons why some SMOs show up and others do not, why some stay in contention longer than others, and why some achieve greater and more enduring success, have to do not only with changes in opportunities and the expansion and appropriation of societal resources, but also with whether frame alignment has been successful effected and sustained
