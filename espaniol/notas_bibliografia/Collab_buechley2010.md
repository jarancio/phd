# LilyPad in the Wild: How Hardwareʼs Long Tail is Supporting New Engineering and Design Communities

## Demographics of community

At its core, the LilyPad community consists of people who are building artifacts with the kit.  
However, it also includes people  who  are  documenting  projects  and  posting  them online,   developing   LilyPad   tutorials,   developing   new LilyPad boards, and contributing to user forums. 

Over   90%   of customers from both groups were from North America and Europe  and  over  75%  of  builders  from  both  groups  were from  these  same  regions
 
Within this  group,  the  median  age  for  Arduino  builders  was  27 (mean 30) and the median for LilyPad builders was 25 (mean 26).

The   gender   balance   of   the   group   who purchased  both  boards  was  somewhere  in  between:  68% male  and  21%  female; there   was   a   strong   relationship   between   a   customer’s gender and the type of board they purchased.
Within  our sample,  women  make  up  a  small  minority  of  Arduino customers  and  a  significantly  larger  percentage  of  LilyPad customers, though still a minority.

Builders: 65% of  the  projects  we  analyzed  were  built  by  women,  but women made up only 35% of LilyPad customer.
LilyPad  customers  are  more  likely  to  construct,  document, and  share  projects  than  their  male  counterparts. 

LilyPad    community    as    one    that    confounds    gender stereotypes    and    demographic    patterns    in    electrical engineering  and  computer  science—both  overwhelmingly male  dominated  fields.

## Projects

Most of the LilyPad projects are textiles, many of  them  are  wearable,  and  several  have  a  design  or artistic focus.   
LilyPad  has  sparked  a  new  community rather than providing tools to an already existing one.

## Broadening participation
Instead of trying to fit people into   existing   engineering   cultures, it   may   be   more constructive totry  to spark  and  support  new  cultures.
When   we   build   new   clubhouses,   new,   surprising,   and valuable things happen.  As our findings on shared LilyPad projects seem    to    support,    a    new    female-dominated electrical  engineering/computer  science  community  may emerge.

## Hardwareʼs  Long  Tail  Revisited:  HCI  Research  and  the “Real World”
Once  a  new  technology  is  distributed  the  team has  access  to  a  group  of  real  world  users  that  they  can study.    This  makes  it  possible  to  assess  things  like  the relationship  between  a  tool’s  design  and  its  adoption  and the    formation    and    evolution    of    new    technological communities.  

These  teams  are uniquely positioned to study the impact of design decisions on  patterns  of  use,  since  researchers  have  access  to  all aspects   of   the   project   from   design   to   dissemination.  Because  of  our  new  ability  to  rapidly  produce  and  deploy systems,  this  style  of  research  can  now  take  place  on relatively  short  time  scales  with  small  but  significant  user communities, even when hardware is involved.
