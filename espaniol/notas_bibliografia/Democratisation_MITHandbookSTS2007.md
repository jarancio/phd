## Chapter 3: Political theory in STS

The most important example of Marxist-influenced STS today is Andrew Feenberg’s critical theory of technology, which develops Marcuse’s analysis of one-dimensional thought and culture into a nuanced
critique of technology. Feenberg’s critical theory aims to expose how biases enter into technological design and how liberatory and democratic interests can instead be engineered into the technical code (Feenberg, 1999).

Where post-Kuhnian sociological analyses demonstrate the way in which science and technology incorporate and embed particular interests and values, critical theory aims both to expose dominatory values and to suggest the possibility of inscribing new values in technological design. 

The solution is not to push back technology to make way for the charismatic return to the world of moral and religious values. Instead, the way forward consists in finding ways to decide democratically what kinds of values we want our technologies to embody and fulfill.

Langdon Winner arrived at similar conclusions in his key works, Autonomous Technology (1978) and The Whale and the Reactor (1986). While strongly influenced by Ellul’s notion that technology has become an autonomous system, Winner, like Feenberg, rejects Ellul’s pessimistic antitechnological stance. Instead, he argues that, just as societies have a political constitution, they also have a technological constitution
and the framing of both are matters of human decision—hence the need for the democratization of technological decision-making.

### Feminist and multicultural approaches
Sociology of Scientific Knowledge and feminist epistemology have in common the constructivist critique of liberal notions of universality and neutrality, and a “conservative” emphasis on the local over the universal. The latter can be seen, in particular, in Donna Haraway’s notion of “situated knowledge” (1991) and Helen Longino’s idea of a “local epistemology” (2002:esp. 184–89).

## Science, technology and participatory democracy

New social movements (NSMs), such as the antinuclear and environmental movements, have played a crucial role in politicizing technical domains that liberal discourse had formerly isolated from the scope of politics (Welsh, 2000; Habermas, 1981; Melucci, 1989).

The shift in the orientation of STS and science policy studies is indicated by the primacy in contemporary discussions in these fields of the idea of “participation.” Demands for participation can be seen as following from what Ezrahi calls the “deinstrumentalization of public actions” (Ezrahi, 1990: 286) or, rather, from the increasingly widespread perception of instrumental justifications of public action as ideological and inadequate. The impersonal instrumental techniques, which Porter (1995) and Ezrahi both argue previously allowed liberal democracies to depoliticize public action in the face of potentially skeptical publics, have themselves become the objects of public distrust (Welsh, 2000).

In that sense, the STS claim that the technical is political is not only a theoretical claim about epistemology but also a description of the new politics that characterizes the risk society (Beck, 1995; Welsh, 2000: 23–33; Fischer, 2000).

However, dominant political, bureaucratic, and scientific
institutions have been either slow, or just unable, to adapt to this new politicization of the technical. Possibilities for realizing this new politics through mainstream institutions of representation remain extremely limited. Despite their declining legitimacy, bureaucratic and technocratic mentalities hold sway in mainstream representative and
political executive institutions. The importance of nonviolent direct action for NSMs is, in part, due to recognition of the impossibility of pursuing the values of the life-world through the representative and bureaucratic means provided by official culture (Welsh, 2000: 150–205; Hardt & Negri, 2005; Ginsberg, 1982).

STS today is increasingly concerned with how to theorize and make practicable structures of public participation in scientific and technological decision-making and design (Kleinman, 2000). In theoretical terms, the concern has been how to conceptualize the role of democratic agency and “participant interests” in technological design (Feenberg, 1999). 

There is a growing body of empirical literature on examples
of lay participation in decision-making in science, technology, and medicine. Steven Epstein’s study of the role of AIDS activists in challenging the norms and procedures of clinical trials remains a crucial point of reference (Epstein, 1996; Feenberg, 1995:96–120; Doppelt, 2001: 171–74; Hardt & Negri, 2005: 189). 

Ideas include town meetings, citizen juries, consensus conferences, and the model of the “citizen scientist” (Sclove, 1995; Fischer, 2000; Irwin, 1995; Kleinman, 2000). This literature has also recently spurred debate
about the coherence of the category of the “expert,” whether the notion of “lay expertise” (Epstein, 1995) goes too far in extending the category (Collins & Evans, 2002).

The notion that technical decisions that affect people’s lives should
be participatory decisions is one that calls into question the very structure of the democratic polity—calling for the radical extension of democracy through everyday life—for democracy to be as pervasive as technology. This means an emphasis on local democracy—in the workplace, community, education, and medical settings. It also means democracy on a global level (Beck, 1995; Hardt & Negri, 2000, 2005).

In the context of globalization, mediating structures of representation and the delegation of authority to experts are increasingly perceived as removing real power from citizens and populaces. Hardt and Negri have recently argued that we are faced with a generalized “crisis of democratic representation” and, they write, “In the era of globalization it is becoming increasingly clear that the historical moment of liber-
alism has passed” (Hardt & Negri, 2005: 273). 

This thesis is echoed, with different emphases, by Turner, who notes that *“A good deal of the phenomena of globalization is the replacement of national democratic control with control by experts” (Turner, 2003a: 131).* 

**This crisis of representation is the context in which questions of the democratization of science and technology come to the fore**
