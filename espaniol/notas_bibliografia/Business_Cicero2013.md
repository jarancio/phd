## Business models

### Manufacturing

Manufacturing ability is no more a differentiator in itself, as knowledge, processes and tools needed to build hardware are radically accessible and shared across hundreds if not thousands of companies. 

One approach (Sparkfun): market advantage resides in company elasticity and in the capability to innovate rapidly a product portfolio.

Business to customer approach (arduino): may only work for that kind of projects that have a strong prosumer/consumer oriented market segment. Also inefficient for the professional context where components may be embedded in final products therefore hiding the brand. 

Dual licensing:  the case of Gaisler Researchâ€™s LEON is a 32-bit CPU microprocessor core, based on the SPARC-V, A LGPL/GPL FLOSS licensed product that also offers a proprietary license for integration in proprietary products

Dual licensing bis: extending the core open product with additional proprietary extensions or versions. 

Professional Services: a bunch of interesting and very focused small companies are bootstrapping businesses around visionary customers exploring IoT, Machine to Machine and hardware innovation

## Crowdsourcing

Tens of hardware related projects appear every month and a significant percentage gets enough traction to be funded, often more than expected.

Projects range from creative niche products (Nixie), to tools (see Open Pitaya), to advanced vertical equipment developed for specific niche needs (such as Piksi and Flutter).

Common traits of these hardware projects funded via crowdfunding are:

- Componentized (common protocols, standardized interfaces)
- Prosumer oriented (targeting a market of early adopters and creators)
- Super niche products (specific features)
- Non R&D intensive
- Strongly focused on solving existing gaps

Its main customer segment, that of creative prosumers, appears to be an evolution of the good old DIY market.
