# AIDS activism, Epstein 1995

*Explores how AIDS activists in the United States have established their credibility as people who might legitimately speak in the language of medical science.*

This case demonstrates that activist movements, through amassing different forms of credibility, can in certain circumstances become genuine participants in the construction of scientific knowledge- that they can (within definite limits) effect changes both in the epistemic practices of biomedical research and in the therapeutic techniques of medical care. This surprising result is, of course, at variance with the popular notion of science as a relatively autonomous arena with high barriers to entry.

Activist movements can, at times, advance their own strategic goals within science, helping to construct new social relationships and identities, new institutions, and new facts and beliefs in the process (cf. Brown 1992; Cozzens and Woodhouse 1995; Cramer, Eyerman, and Jamison 1987; Di Chiro 1992; Petersen 1984; Rycroft 1991). Medicine, to be sure, is an arena more permeable to outside influence than other less public, less applied, and less politicized domains of technoscience (Cozzens and Woodhouse 1995, 538).

As Shapin (1994) has emphasized, credibility is the backbone of the cognitive and moral order in modem scientific inquiry, and trusting relationships are a sine qua non of scientific practice (see also Barnes 1985; Barnes and Edge 1982; Latour and Woolgar 1986; Shapin and Schaffer 1985; Star 1989, 138-44;Williams and Law 1980). Questions of credibility may emerge as particularly salient in fields, such as AIDS research, that are marked by extreme degrees of controversy, uncertainty, and, in particular, politicization (cf. Martin 1991, chap. 4). When various interested publics pay attention to the progress of research and expect answers, a "credibility gap" may develop if solutions are not forthcoming. Indeed, despite the suspicion of expertise that has become rampant in many quarters, people in advanced industrial societies do typically expect doctors and scientists to protect them from the effects of epidemic disease. The failure of the experts to solve the problem of AIDS quickly, as they were "supposed to" do, has heightened popular resentment and diminished the credibility of the establishment; **it has also opened up more space for dissident voices.**

The science of AIDS therefore cannot simply be analyzed "from the top down"; it demands attention to what Foucault has called the "microphysics of power" in contemporary Western societies-the dispersal of fluxes of power throughout all the cracks and crevices of the social system; the omnipresence of resistance as imminent to the exercise of power at each local site; and the propagation of knowledges, practices, subjects, and meanings out of the local deployment of power (Foucault 1979, 1983).

The AIDS movement, in other words, was built on the foundation of the gay and lesbian movement and borrowed from its particular strengths and inclinations. It mattered that gay communities had pre-existing organizations that could mobilize to meet a new threat, and it mattered that these communities contained (and in fact were dominated by) white, middle-class men with a degree of political clout and fund-raising capacity unusual for an oppressed group. It was crucially important, as well, that gay communities possessed relatively high degrees of "cultural capital"- cultivated  dispositions for appropriating knowledge and culture (Bourdieu 1990).These communities contain many people who are themselves doctors, scientists, educators, nurses, professionals, or intellectuals of other varieties. **On the one hand, this cultural capital has provided the AIDS movement with an unusual capacity to contest the mainstream experts on their own ground. On the other hand, it facilitates mediation and communication between "experts" and "the public."** *[Note: important for advantages of having experts in GOSH]*

## Credibility Tactics

a) The most crucial avenue pursued by treatment activists in the construction of their scientific credibility has been precisely the acquisition of such competence by learning the language and culture of medical science. 

Although activists have benefited from the presence of a few medical and scientific professionals within their ranks, typically the leading lights of the treatment activist movement have been autodidacts who began as science novices but came from positions of relative social advantage. 

To quote Lein (1993) again, "I mean, I walk in with, you know, seven earrings in one ear and a mohawk and my ratty old jacket on, and people are like, oh great, one of these street activists who don't know anything." But once she opens her mouth and demonstrates that she knows her stuff, she finds that researchers are often inclined, however reluctantly, to address her concerns with some seriousness.

b) A basic "credibility achievement" of treatment activists has been their capacity to present themselves as the legitimate, organized voice of people with AIDS or HIV infection (or, more specifically, the current or potential clinical trial subject population). 

On the basis of their credibility, activists thus constructed themselves as an "obligatory passage point" (Latour 1987) standing between the researchers and the trials they sought to conduct (cf. Crowley 1991). Of course, by the ame token, the activists wanted to see the trials conducted; so the point, really, is that
the relationship became a powerfully symbiotic one.

c) yoking together methodological (or epistemological) arguments and moral (or political) arguments so as to monopolize different forms of credibility in different domains. 

d) Taking of sides in pre-existing debates over how clinical research should be done. E.g., on 'clean data':  The metaphors of cleanliness, elegance, and so on varied from the realm of hygiene to that of social status, but the implication in each case was similar: the defense of science put forward by mainstream researchers was an ideology designed to promote the kind of science they happened to do as the only kind that could be called science.

## Participatory Knowledge Making in Biomedicine

It mattered that biomedicine is relatively more open to outside scrutiny than are other arenas of science and technology (Cozzensand Solomon 1994).

It also mattered that activists were able to master the technical arcana in ways that even credentialed experts found impressive; that they were able to make effective use of existing differences of opinion among credentialed experts; and that they were able to weave back and forth between epistemological, methodological, political, and ethical claims to construct powerful arguments that proved effective in both specialized and public arenas.

## Conclusions

Once activists succeeded in establishing their credibility, they were able to gain representation

Of course some researchers and government officials have deemed it strategic to incorporate activists into the process.

In general, this recent reconfiguration of the boundaries (Gieryn 1983) between the "inside" and the "outside" of biomedicine has been the outcome of struggle. 

By introducing new "currencies" of credibility into circulation, and by succeeding in establishing a value for those currencies within the scientific field, activists in effect have transformed the field's mechanisms of operation (Bourdieu 1990). In certain respects, they have transformed how biomedical knowledge gets made (Epstein 1993).

These groups challenge the hierarchical relations between experts and laypeople and insist on the rights of those affected by biomedical-science to participate in its production. As opposed to those movements that confront expertise by finding their own experts to represent them-what Gaventa (1985) has called the "hired gun" approach-these movements seek "to break down the distinction between the researchers and the researched, the subjects and objects of knowledge production by the participation of the people-for-themselves in the process of gaining and creating knowledge" 

The case of AIDS treatment activism suggests that so-called "new social movements" have distinctive forms of engagement with science and that the engagement with science shapes such movements in quite distinctive ways.
