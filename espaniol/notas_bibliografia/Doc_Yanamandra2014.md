# Evaluating level of openness in OSHW

One of the biggest factors aiding the success of open source software is its capability
for modularity and the adequate focus given to the various modules by programmers
thereafter. 

This modularity and focus is lacking in the field of open source hardware.
Hardware systems are taken up in totality for study and research. Sometimes, this
can be overwhelming given the fact that design of open source hardware neces-
sitates high levels of expertise across a broad range of areas. Also, in the current
situation, people working on such hardware systems do not have the necessary
technical expertise for aiding in the design and conceiving a complete hardware
system. 

Successful version control must also be implemented on a variety of files
which are both visual and textual in format. There must be a standardized con-
vention of versioning various firmware/design/manufacturing/documentation
changes to products. Also, detailed tutorials for utilizing all the features of GitHub
such as pulling, forking, merging, and discovering repositories must be made
available to enhance the level of involvement of community members.

for the successful
advancement of open source hardware, every user in the community must be able to
effectively understand and utilize open source hardware technologies so as to pro-
vide meaningful feedback for its continual improvement. However, there are various
technical and knowledge barriers which are seen to hinder such steady progress.
