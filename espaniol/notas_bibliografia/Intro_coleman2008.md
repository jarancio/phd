# Hacker practice: moral genres and the cultural articulation of liberalism}

The literature on hackers, thus, tends to collapse hacking into a moral binary in which hackers are either lauded or denounced. 
But  hacker morality in fact exists as multiple, overlapping genres that converge with broader prevailing political and cultural processes, such as those of liberalism.
A quick gloss of the language that hackers frequently invoke to describe themselves or formulate ethical claims – freedom, free speech, privacy, the individual, meritocracy – discloses liberal imprints and concerns.

Elaborating a sense of what freedom is and what it means to be free constitutes moral discourse for hackers (cf. Coleman, 2004; Kelty, 2005, 2008).
However, while this definition of the hacker ethic may accurately reference a general set of moral commitments still in existence today, the actual articulation of this ethos has taken on multiple, though coherent forms.
The themes raised again and again by hackers – free speech, meritocracy, privacy, the power of the individual – suggest that we can read the hacker material
as a cultural case in which long-standing liberal ideals are reworked in the context of interaction with technical systems to create a diverse but related set of expressions concerning selfhood, property, privacy, labor, and creativity. 

Charles Taylor has argued that western society in the past 200 years has witnessed the emergence of what he calls the ‘expressive self ’. 
Taylor claims that this notion of subjectivity rests on three main points. 
First, that humans are capable of exteriorizing their inner selves through creative action; second, that this action is a deeply moral act; and third, that it is not enough simply for the subject to act, but that its acts must be recognized by others for them to be truly expressive of itself (Taylor, 1989).
The ways in which hackers address the liberal claims at the same time reveal points of tension with liberalism (surveillance, intellectual property).

Through regular and shared routine practices of their ordinary, technical life, which are not fully or always available to conscious reflection, hackers come to collectively embody evaluative moral and aesthetic dispositions in which knowledge is sacred territory; access to and personal control over the means of
information creation and circulation is valued as essential; and technical activity is often experienced as the vehicle for self-fashioning and creative self-expression. 

While much of hacker ethical discourse draws from and reformulates liberal commitments, hackers embody a form of subjectivity and formulate an implicit politics often denied by liberal theory; they align more closely to the flexible subjectivities and poetic politics identified by theorists as notable characteristics of the postcolonial experience (Bhabha, 1994; Gilroy, 1993; Ortiz, 1995).

In the last few years the explosion of leftist and anarchist politics critical of economic globalization has attracted hacker sympathies (Coleman, 2005a; Riemens, 2004).
