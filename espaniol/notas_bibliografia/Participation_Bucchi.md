## Chapter 19: Science and public participation (Bucchi & Neresini)

The theme of public participation with regard to science has come
with new force to attention in conjunction with the crisis of the so-called deficit model of public understanding of science (Wynne, 1991, 1995). 

This model has emphasized the public’s inability to understand and appreciate the achievements of science— owing to prejudicial public hostility as well as to misrepresentation by the mass media—and adopted a linear, pedagogical and paternalistic view of communication to argue that the quantity and quality of the public communication of science should
be improved.

More in general, the disjunction between expert and lay knowledge cannot be reduced to a mere information gap between experts and the general public as envisaged by the deficit model.  

Lay knowledge is not an impoverished or quantitatively inferior version of expert knowledge; it is qualitatively different. Factual information
is only one ingredient of lay knowledge, in which it interweaves with other elements (value judgments, trust in the scientific institutions, the person’s perception of his or her ability to put scientific knowledge to practical use) to form a corpus no less sophisticated than specialist expertise.3

Callon invokes the need for another, more substantial shift to a model of knowledge co-production in which the role of nonexperts and their local knowledge can be conceived as neither an obstacle to be overcome by virtue of appropriate education initiatives (as in the deficit model) nor as an additional element that simply enriches professionals’ expertise (as in the critical-interpretative model) but rather as essential for the production of knowledge itself. 

Relations between new social movements and science have always been characterized by a marked ambivalence. According to social movement theorists (Touraine, 1978, 1985; Melucci at al., 1989; Melucci, 1996; Castells, 1997), the distinctive features of such movements are the ways in which they construct an individual and collective identity, define the adversary, and structure a vision of the world put forwardas an alternative to the dominant one. It is evident that science and technology are bound up with each of these three features.

On the one hand, science and technology are often an integral part of the “enemy” against which the new social movements mobilize. They are viewed as instruments of the dominant power and as responsible for the perverse effects of globalization, especially so now that the connection between scientific research and economic interests is increasingly apparent. This is a connection that STS has repeatedly analyzed, and from various standpoints (Etzkowitz, 1990; Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1993; Ziman, 2000).
Once again the case of biotechnologies is paradigmatic: the science sustained by—and therefore subservient to—the multinationals is seen as threatening the future of the environment (destruction of biodiversity), jeopardizing human health (harmful emissions), and increasing the third world’s dependence on the industrialized countries (it erodes the social bases of small-scale farming in the developing countries [Shiva, 1993]). For these reasons, it is an enemy to be fought against.

Yet science and technology are also resources for the identity, organization, and action of the new movements themselves. 

This “ambiguous, deep connection with science and technology” (Castells, 1997:123; Yearley, 1992) enables the new social movements, especially the environmentalist ones, to play a significant part in the production of scientific knowledge itself. As Yearley has pointed out, this participation may take place at various levels. First, a number of NGOs have set up laboratories and research facilities in order to have their
own scientists produce independent scientific research (Yearley, 1995:462). 

In the case of the more mature Dutch experience, “science shops started out as a counterculture phenomenon in the 1970s, but by the end of 1980s, most had become regular elements of university organization” (Wachelder 2003: 253–54). In certain respects, science shops can be viewed as a
“bottom up” interpretation of what is termed community-based research, especially when they are intended to promote public participation not only in specific research projects but also more generally in research policies (Sclove, 1998).

We can trace, the history of the policy framing of such relationships by analyzing the linguistic shifts in documents and funding schemes of national and international institutions: from “public awareness of science” to “citizen involvement,” from “communication” to “dialogue,” from “science and society” to “science in society.”5 In some countries, Switzerland for example, specific agencies have been established to undertake “participatory technology assessment” of upcoming innovations on behalf of parliaments or governments (Joss & Bellucci, 2002).


**Has a good chart of Forms of Public Participation in Science Elicited by a Sponsor**

Three broad categories of public engagement:    

• public communication, “maximizing the relevant information flow from the sponsor to the maximum number of relevant population”;    
• public consultation, “maximizing the relevant information flow from the maximum number of the relevant population and transferring it to the sponsor”    
**public participation**: “maximizing the relevant information from the maximum number of all relevant sources and transferring it to the other parties” (Rowe & Frewer, 2005: 254–55).

Differences between specific participatory procedures can then be related to a series of variables associated with the above objectives (e.g., maximization of relevant participants, maximization of relevant information from participants). This typology has several advantages: most notably, it highlights similarities and differences between mechanisms and thereby paves the way for conceptual clarification and thorough impact evaluation. 

**Why this tipology doesn't work?**     
First, it anchors public engagement to a notion of information flow—described as a rather mechanical process of “transfer”—which seems largely to reprise the limits of the deficit model and traditional communication paradigms, the main difference being that it envisages the possibility of two-way transfer (i.e., not only from the sponsor/experts to the participants but also from participants to the sponsor/experts).8
However, hybrid forums often involve not only the exchange of information among the actors concerned but also the negotiation and production of new identities (Callon, 1999).

Second, defining relevance as a key concept for the typology is only unproblematic if a specific point of view is adopted. Who defines which information is relevant? Who defines which population is relevant? Is it the sponsor promoting the specific participatory initiative? The potential participants? 

This brings to the fore a third, and probably more substantial, shortcoming of the typology: the fact that it is limited only to mechanisms actively promoted by a sponsor.

We propose an interpretative framework able to account also for “spontaneous” participatory forms:

This framework is partly based on the one used by Callon and colleagues (2001) to classify hybrid forums and adopts one of its key dimensions: the intensty of cooperation among different actors in knowledge production processes (Callon et al., 2001:175). While intensity should, of course, be understood as a continuum, some key gradations can be identified, what in Callon et al. correspond to “access points” where nonexperts can intervene. One such point is the moment when laboratory results are “translated” to real-life situations, which is a crucial stage in the stabilization of scientific knowledge (Callon et al., 2001: 89ff.). 

A second and more substantial degree of participation corresponds to the access point offered by what Callon and colleagues (2001) call “the definition of the research collective,” for instance, when members of AIDS patient associations managed to gain involvement in the design of experiments and drug trial tests, thereby broadening the research collective to include nonresearchers.

The public may even participate in the initial recognition of research problems, for example, by making a particular event or series of events leave the limbo of happenstance and enter the realm of problems warranting expert interest and attention. The public may also accumulate the initial stock of knowledge required to make professional research possible and worthwhile. 

The second axis of our diagram plots the extent to which public participation is elicited by a sponsor: what could be defined, with a certain amount of simplification, as the degree of spontaneity of public participation. Here again, the variable should be viewed as a continuum, with the participatory initiatives described by Rowe and Frewer at the upper end of the axis and protest movements and research activities of patient and resident organizations at the lower end. 

Over time, public participation with regard to a certain issue may move along one or both dimensions.

The use of inevitably broad labels such as “nonexperts” or “lay public” should not lead us to flatten the intrinsic variety of citizens’ involvement and their significantly differentiated capability and interest to shape knowledge production processes.

The question of “who participates” remains open for future research not less than the question of “which forms of participation.”

It is clear that not only may different expert-public interaction patterns gradually shift one into another but that even at a given time, a certain technoscientific theme may witness different configurations of such interaction, involving different groups of experts and nonexperts. Accordingly, our proposed interpretative framework seeks to account for the simultaneous coexistence of different patterns of participation that may coalesce depending on specific conditions and on the issues at stake—from the “zero degree” of participation entailed by the deficit model to the most substantial forms of cooperation. In this light, rather than “which model of participation accounts best” for expert-public interactions, one of the key questions becomes “under what conditions do different forms of public participation emerge?”

### Conclusions 

Contemporary democracies are considered ill equipped to deal with such
issues, and their current institutional arrangements are seen as unable to withstand a powerful injection of technoscience. “Innovation in natural knowledge and in its technological applications demands a corresponding capacity for social innovation” (Jasanoff, 2004a: 91).

Pressures for public participation in science can also be viewed as part of more general criticism of the capacity of traditional democracies to represent and include citizens’ points of view when addressing global challenges, with crucial decisions being more and more taken at levels not directly subject to citizens’ influence. This is the “democratic deficit” that is frequently a matter of concern with regard to, for instance, European or international institutions.12 Science is obviously not extraneous to such challenges, for it highlights and fosters new processes of inclusion and exclusion that shape the meaning itself of citizenship (Jasanoff, 2004a, 2005).

In similar vein, Latour has called for the institution of a “Parliament of things”— where both nature and social collectives can be thoroughly explored—and for the design of new “rules of the method” to guide the sociotechnical experiments—like global warming, BSE, GM food—now blurring the boundaries between experts and nonexperts as well as the boundaries of laboratories, which expand to encompass houses, farms, and hospitals (Latour, 2004).

If the “anaesthetization” of politics by the massive injection of technoscientific expertise has been not sufficient to deal with crucial dilemmas, this is not a reason to expect that those same dilemmas will be solved simply by injecting democratic arrangements into science, especially if democracy is defined with its most simplistic meaning of “majority voting.” Democracy, like science, cannot be taken as given; just as the latter is transformed by the entry of citizens into research laboratories, so the former is transformed when, for instance, scientists protest in public or propose a “compromise” on the public funding of stem cell research (Shaywitz & Mellon, 2004).). From a broader historical perspective, this role of science in the development of democracy has been significantly documented as regards not only the mere supplying of technical competences for policy deliberation but also the shaping of democracy’s argumentative styles.

Straightforward confrontations between experts and the public are being replaced by unstable, hetereogeneous “ethno-epistemic assemblages” of experts, citizens, patients, stakeholders, and human and nonnonhuman actors (Irwin & Michael, 2003).

Yet “participation” should not be reified as a circumscribed, static event—nor, in the perspective of certain institutions sponsoring participatory activities, as a prerogative that can be switched on and off at will. Rather, it should be viewed as a process that fluidly assumes different contingent configurations. A certain notion of the relationship between professional experts and the public—for example, as segregated categories in the deficit model or as inextricably intertwined as in the co-production model—is in itself a result of, and not a precondition for, the struggles, negotiations, and alliances taking place in those configurations. Nonexperts’ interactions with technoscience are embedded in a wider “civic epistemology,” which in turn includes
participatory styles as one of its central elements (Jasanoff, 2005).

In broader terms, public participation is today one of the key dynamics at the core of the co-evolutionary, co-production processes (Nowotny et al., 2001; Jasanoff, 2004b, 2005) redefining the meanings of science and the public, knowledge and citizenship, expertise and democracy.
