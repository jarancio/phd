# Opening options for material transfer

Material-transfer   agreements   (MTAs)   underlie  the  legal  frameworks  within  which biotechnology practitioners define the terms and conditions for sharing biomateri-als ranging, for example, from plasmid DNA to  patient  samples.  If  MTAs  are  easy  to  use  and  well  adapted  to  the  needs  of  individual  researchers,  institutions,  and  broader  com-munities,  then  more  sharing,  innovation,  and translation can occur.

However, the MTA frameworks currently in place were developed in  the  1990s—before  widespread  adoption  of  the  World  Wide  Web,  genome  sequenc-ing, and gene synthesis—and are not always well adapted for contemporary research and translation  practices  or  aligned  with  social  objectives

Goal: simple,  standardized  legal  tool  for  sharing  biological  materials  as  broadly  as  possible  without undue restrictions, while respecting the rights of creators and promoting safe prac-tices  and  responsible  research.  Importantly,  we wanted the tool to work within the practi-cal realities of technology transfer and to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the needs of  many  groups  globally 

# Now 
Currently,  the  most  used  MTA  in  biol-ogy   and   biotechnology   is   the   Uniform   Biological   Material   Transfer   Agreement   (UBMTA), which was developed and widely adopted  in  the  1990s  (https://www.ott.nih.gov/resources/).

Most widely used MTAs place two restric-tions on material transfers, neither of which is often useful or desired (Ta b l e  1). First, MTAs typically disallow redistribution of materials (i.e., so-received materials cannot formally be shared with others). Second, any and all com-mercial uses of the so-received biomaterials are  specifically  prohibited.  Although  these  two restrictions are appropriate for materials that  require  tight  control  of  provenance  for  reasons of safety, security, or commercializa-tion,  such  restrictions  make  little  sense  for  most of the materials used widely throughout research (for example, basic samples, strains, or  plasmids). 

The desire of these researchers and organiza-tions to share materials freely is rooted in the idea that, although there may be limited value in each of these tools individually, there is great value in their widespread use by researchers and others collectively. This idea is particularly relevant  to  synthetic  biology,  in  which  stan-dards have been developed for the interoperability of modular DNA components or parts, and in which remixing of numerous parts is normal  practice.

# Dratfing OpenMTA

The  OpenMTA  was  developed  as  a  collab-orative effort led by the BioBricks Foundation and the OpenPlant Synthetic Biology Research Centre.  

Working  group  comprising  researchers,  technology-transfer  professionals,  social  scientists,  legal  experts,  and  others  interested  in  creating  a  legal  framework  that  could  improve  shar-ing  of  biomaterials.

5 goals: access, attribution, reuse, redistribution, and nondiscrimination (to be consistent with the Open  Definition)

Additional  design  goals  included  issues of safety and, in particular, the sharing of  biomaterials  in  an  international  context.  

Like  all  MTAs,  the  OpenMTA  is  a  contract—a  bargained-for  exchange  of consideration—wherein  materials  from  the  provider are given in exchange for a promise by the recipient to abide by the terms of the agreement, including attribution, reporting back,  and  payment  of  a  fee  for  processing  if  requested. 

Differences  between  the  OpenMTA  and  other  standard  templates  arise  via  differ-ences in design—specifically that researchers be  allowed  to  use  the  materials  for  any  law-ful purpose, including commercial purposes, and may also redistribute the materials to oth-ers, subject to reporting back if requested by the providing institution. 

Becoming  a  sig-natory  to  the  OpenMTA  Master  Agreement  provides  an  institution  and  its  researchers  the option of transferring materials under the terms of the OpenMTA but does not obligate its exclusive use.

Additionally,  because  the  OpenMTA  does  not  include  a  ‘viral’ clause, institutions may accept incoming materials under the OpenMTA, use or modify so-received materials, and then subsequently redistribute the materials or derivatives under the  same  or  different  terms. 

We anticipate that the OpenMTA will be most useful for the transfer of biomaterials used in precompetitive  research,  such  as  plasmids,  strains, and samples, whose quantities are not limited, owing to the easily replicated nature of  the  materials,  and  for  which  the  value  of  individual  materials  is  relatively  low,  owing  to  alternative  sourcing  options.  We  further  anticipate  that  the  OpenMTA  may  be  well  suited as a default institutional policy in con-texts in which most materials are intended to be freely shared. We note that the OpenMTA is not suitable for all transfers, such as materials that are in limited quantity or subject to strict biosecurity regulations

RE: human materials, Additional  complexities including privacy, consent, and institutional-review-board approval must be addressed,  and  we  are  working  with  others  to  develop  an  OpenMTA  for  such  materi-als.
