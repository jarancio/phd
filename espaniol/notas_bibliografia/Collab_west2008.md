# Getting Clear About Communities in Open Innovation

Concurrent with the rise in studies of community in the innovation process, there hasbeen a parallel and distinct body of literature focused on ‘‘open innovation’’ (Chesbrough,  2003;Chesbroughet al., 2006; Gassmann, 2006). This literature has tended to focus on interfirm cooperation and the development ofan ecosystem of firms, sharing technologies and trading intellectual property, within a givenindustry or sector (cf. Westet al., 2006).

However, non-firm actors such as communities arerarely to be found in the recent writings on open innovation. However, community-basedinnovation  by  its  nature  takes  place  outside  the  boundaries  of  the  firm,  which  fits Chesbrough’s definition (2003) of open innovation.
