# Getting Clear About Communities in Open Innovation

Concurrent with the rise in studies of community in the innovation process, there hasbeen a parallel and distinct body of literature focused on ‘‘open innovation’’ (Chesbrough,  2003;Chesbroughet al., 2006; Gassmann, 2006). This literature has tended to focus on interfirm cooperation and the development ofan ecosystem of firms, sharing technologies and trading intellectual property, within a givenindustry or sector (cf. Westet al., 2006).

However, non-firm actors such as communities arerarely to be found in the recent writings on open innovation. However, community-basedinnovation  by  its  nature  takes  place  outside  the  boundaries  of  the  firm,  which  fits Chesbrough’s definition (2003) of open innovation.

In scholarly research, the definition of community may be explicit, implicit or phenomenological.

## Defining the Community Construct in Open Innovation

Building upon the definition of **Gläser** (Gläser, J. 2001), we consider a community to be a *voluntary association of actors, typically lacking in a priori common organizational affiliation (i.e. not working for the same firm) but united by a shared instrumental goal* —in this case, creating, adapting, adopting or disseminating innovations.

Secondly, in this review we focus on innovations that are explicitly brought to market or widespread use by commercial actors. While some community innovations have a purely non‐profit motivation and thus do not overlap the definition of open innovation (West and Gallagher, 2006), *many of the principles of community innovation described below would apply to non‐profit actors as well*.

What is the level of analysis for the community's constituent members?

“Innovation communities can have users and/or manufacturers as members and contributors" (von Hippel 2005)

**Networks** play a central role in organizing the open innovation activities of multiple cooperating firms (see Vanhaverbeke, 2006 for a review). 
Certainly there are overlaps in the definition between networks and communities, such as Powell's emphasis (Powell, W. W. 1990) on reputation, norms of reciprocity and mutually beneficial interactions.

## Intra‐community Interactions

What interactions constitute the basis for a group of individuals and/or firms to be in a community? 
Is a community more than just a grouping of individuals (or other actors)? 
Is there a community if there's no sense of community (Corlett, 1989)? 

The communities of practice literature stipulates that knowledge transfer between community members is the key prerequisite to organizational learning, particularly for communities subsumed within an organization. 
The only reason we remark on the community of practice exemplified by Brown and Duguid's copier technicians (Brown, J. S. and Duguid, P. 1991) is that their interactions allow them to share, refine, pool and disseminate best practice for their work responsibilities.

Among studies related to open innovation, the intra‐community linkages in some studies are more explicit than others. User innovation researchers have studied the peer‐to‐peer assistance in open source software (Lakhani and von Hippel, 2003). 
For these cases, the community support facilitates adoption and use of the innovation.

Intra‐community interactions also offer the prospect of defining the boundaries of a given innovation community. 
The boundaries may not be sharply defined, as the differences between core and periphery may be more dramatic than the differences between peripheral members and nonmembers. 
However appealing such core–periphery distinctions are, they may be highly dependent on both definitional and methodological choices made by researchers as to what constitutes community membership. 

From a sample of 116 SourceForge projects, Crowston et al. (Crowston, K., Wei, K., Li, Q. and Howison, J. 2006) found different definitions of core membership by using formal responsibilities, code contributions and network interactions.

Any definition of “community” needs to consider whether the construct applies to associations of firms (as opposed to individuals or mixed groupings). 
If so, how do “communities” differ from other constructs—particularly Powell's definition of a network (Powell, W. W. 1990), with its open‐ended interdependence and relational coordination? Are there communities within networks or networks within communities?
