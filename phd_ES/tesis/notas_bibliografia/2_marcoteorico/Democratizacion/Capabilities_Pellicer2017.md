## Grassroots Social Innovation for Human Development: An Analysis of Alternative Food Networks in the City of Valencia (Spain)

> The paper brings together three different approaches: social innovation (SI), grassroots innovation (GI) and capability approach (CA) in order to provide a better framework for studying social transformation, using Alternative Food Networks as a case study. Useful for the CA categories.

### The capability approach (CA)

**Core categories**    
- Agency
- Capabilities
- Deliberative democracy
- Conversion factors

How we can measure the real contribution of SI to bring transformative change in individuals and social relationships (Echeverr√≠a 2010; Hubert 2010)?

#### Agents

Focus on the people. Each person is a dignified and responsible human being who shapes her/his own life in the light of goals that matter to her/him, rather than simply being instructed how to think (Walker and Unterhalter
2007).

As Alkire (2002) and Walker and Unterhalter (2007) mention when referring to the process of education, agency is a process of both being and becoming. It can further expand and advance our well-being, but it is a process and needs to be embraced over several areas of action

#### Capabilities

Social innovation is a process that should expand the capabilities people have to reach the goals they value, at an individual or collective level (Sen, 1999)

If an individual is considered as an able being willing to participate in SI, then SI is considered a process of ensuring one's agency, to self-determine and to bring about change in the world (Crocker, 2008)

#### Deliberative democracy

Public discussion and democratic decision-making (Crocker, 2008), where agency and collectivity have a crucial role. Individuals are seen as socially embedded agents who interact with their socities and participate in social and political affairs (Nussbaum 1997; Sen 2002)

Deliberative democracy is based on the principle that encouraging individuals to participate in local decision-making encourages them to decide together how to construct an idea of the good. Hence, the relationships between agency and deliberative democracy are mutually reinforcing.

#### Conversion factors (Robeyns, 2005)

The personal traits (e.g. physical condition, gender, ethnicity or intelligence), social arrangements (e.g. public policies, norms, values and power relations) and environmental conditions (e.g. pollution, state of the roads and communication) which determine the ability of a person to convert a specific vector of commodities into capabilities or valuable outcomes.

### Limits of participation

Different levels of participation coexist in each of the groups, and even for each individual, depending on their personal circumstance.

As the literature on participation suggests, these different levels of participation have direct implications with power structures within the groups (Arnstein 1969); because even though, theoretically, all voices have the same value, in practice the opinions of these leading, more active, members are
usually more respected.

This entails the idea that democratic and horizontal spaces may not be enough to achieve real participation. As Gaventa (2006) mentions, participation may limit visible power (e.g. that achieved due to hierarchical structure or economic social class), but it may be unable to avoid other forms such as hidden or invisible power (e.g. the case of actors who are powerful because they have more access to information, or more knowledge about the agro-food model, or more active just because they have more availability). As Cooke and Kothari (2001) and Hickey and Mohan (2004) mention, participation can become a tyranny and lead to an unjust and illegitimate exercise of power.
