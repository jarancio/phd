## The Capability Approach: Its Potential for Work in Education
### Melanie Walker and Elaine Unterhalter (2007)

Sen defines a capability as “a person’s ability to do valuable acts or reach valuable states of being; [it] represents the alternative combinations of things a person is able to do or be” (Sen 1993, p. 30).

Embraces “ethical individualism” (Robeyns 2005, p. 108), a normative approach that stresses that actions should be judged by their effects
on individual human beings and that individuals are the “primary objects
of moral concern”(Brighouse and Swift 2003, p. 358).

Evaluating capabilities, rather than resources or outcomes, shifts the axis of analysis to establishing and evaluating the conditions that enable individuals to take decisions based on what they have reason to value. These conditions will vary in different contexts, but the approach sets out to be sensitive to human diversity; complex social relations; a sense of reciprocity between people; appreciation that people can reflect reasonably on what they value for themselves and others; and a concern to equalize, not opportunities or outcomes, but rather capabilities.

###  Equality of what?     
In education this question emerges in philosophical and
sociological work on how to theorize and analyze the provision of equivalent learning opportunities (e.g., Brighouse 2000; Ball 2003).

Crucial to this is the process for people to come to decisions about what
they have reason to value in and from education, or any other aspect of
social action.

### Capabilities and Functionings    
Functionings are achieved outcomes. The difference between a capability and functioning is one between an opportunity to achieve and the actual achievement, between potential and outcome.

This distinction is very important because evaluating only functionings
or outcomes can give too little information about how well people are
doing. Some cases may look as though the same functionings have been
achieved but behind these equal outcomes may lie very different stories, and it is the difference that is germane to thinking about justice and equality

### Freedoms and Agency    
People are understood to be active participants in development, rather than passive spectators. 

Agency here is taken to mean that each person is a dignified and
responsible human being who shapes her or his own life in the light of goals that matter, rather than simply being shaped or instructed how to think.

Agency is intrinsically important for individual freedom, he argues, but also instrumental for collective action and democratic participation. We exercise our agency individually and in cooperation with others, and through educational opportunities and appropriate processes we might learn to do both.

Adapted preferences: We adjust our hopes to our probabilities, even if these are not in our best interests, according to socio-economic environment

### Capabilities in learning & education
In the capability approach, education is assumed (and expected) to be
empowering and transformative. 

Nussbaum (1997, 2002, 2004, 2006) identifie three key capabilities associated with education: 

1- critical thinking or “the examined life”;
2- the ideal of the world citizen; 
3- the development of the narrative imagination

According to Sen (1999), education:

1- Fulfills an instrumental social role in that critical literacy, for example, fosters public debate and dialogue about social and political arrangements. 
2- Has an instrumental process role by expanding the people one comes into contact with, broadening our horizons. 
3- Has an empowering and distributive role in facilitating the ability of the disadvantaged, marginalized, and excluded to organize politically. 

It has redistributive effects between social groups, households, and within families. Overall, education contributes to interpersonal effects where people are able to use the benefits of education to help others and hence contribute to the social good and democratic freedoms.

Individual agency depends also on social and economic arrangements (for example, the level of provision of education or health care) and on political and civil rights, so that Sen comments that there is “a deep complementarity between individual agency and social arrangements” and that individual freedom is “a social commitment” (Sen 1999, pp. xi–xii)

### Conversion factors
Sen’s (1992, 1999) metric of equality includes both personal evaluation and interpersonal variation, as well as individual and social arrangements. 

As Robeyns (2005) explains, both material and nonmaterial circumstances shape the opportunities that we have and the choices that we make

Learners differ in intersecting dimensions. These include personal differences such as enthusiasm for academic study or artistic ability; environmental differences, such as wealth or whether children live in a society with a history of education inequalities such as the UK or greater equalities such as Sweden; and social differences, for example, the extent to which race, ethnic, or gender differences are salient with regard to the experience of education. 

There is nothing inherently unequal about difference or the intersection of differences, but differences can become inequalities (Terzi 2005).
